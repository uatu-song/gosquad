Based on my research, I can provide you with a comprehensive overview of philosophical thinking about utopias—both what defines them and why philosophers argue they're impossible.
What Makes a Utopia?
The term "utopia" was coined by Sir Thomas More in his 1516 book describing an imaginary island society with near-perfect conditions for its inhabitants Utopia | Definition, Examples, & Facts | Britannica. Interestingly, More created the word from Greek roots meaning "no place"—suggesting from the very beginning that such perfection exists nowhere Utopia | Definition, Examples, & Facts | Britannica.
Utopian thought is born from the premise that through reason and intelligence, humankind can create an ideal society where every individual achieves fulfillment without infringing on others' happiness and well-being Utopia - New World Encyclopedia. Key characteristics typically include:

Rational organization: Rationality has always been a criterion of utopias, making utopian thinking a special kind of philosophical thinking distinct from religious visions of paradise Utopianism, Ancient and Modern - Imprimis
Perfect harmony: Resolution of social, political, and economic problems
Equality: Fair distribution of resources and opportunities
Absence of conflict: Peace and stability maintained throughout society

Plato's Republic serves as the foundational utopian text, describing a society ruled by philosopher-kings where justice reigns and wisdom guides all decisions Utopia - Wikipedia.
Why Utopias Cannot Exist: Philosophical Critiques
1. The Problem of Value Pluralism
This is perhaps the most fundamental philosophical argument. Philosopher Lyman Tower Sargent argues that the nature of a utopia is inherently contradictory because societies are not homogeneous—their members have desires that conflict and therefore cannot simultaneously be satisfied Utopia - Wikipedia.
Isaiah Berlin and other philosophers championed value pluralism, which holds that there are multiple fundamental values (like liberty and equality) that may be equally valid yet inherently conflict with each other, and these conflicts cannot always be rationally resolved Stanford Encyclopedia of PhilosophyWikipedia. What seems like a utopian state to one person may be a cruelly biased elitist system to another Can Utopias Exist? Why Achieving A "Perfect Society" Is Actually Impossible.
2. Karl Popper's Critique of Blueprint Utopianism
Karl Popper argued that "blueprint utopianism"—the idea that we must first design the perfect society and then determine how to achieve it—inherently leads to violence and totalitarianism Philosophical Disquisitions: Popper's Critique of Utopianism and Defence of Negative Utilitarianism. Such projects are dangerous because they tend to justify extreme measures and severe human suffering in the present as necessary to secure greater happiness in the future Karl Popper: Political Philosophy | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.
Popper criticized utopianism for attempting to reconstruct society as a whole without sufficient experience to do so, noting that such holistic engineering paradoxically doesn't allow for genuine social experimentation Karl Popper and the social engineering: utopian vs. piecemeal. He advocated instead for "piecemeal engineering"—making modest, incremental changes to society one institution at a time.
3. Human Nature and Imperfection
A fundamental objection is that a perfect society requires perfect humans, and since humans are inherently imperfect creatures with flaws, self-interest, and conflicting desires, a utopia cannot truly exist Medium123 Help Me. Utopias fail because they try to give us what we want, but what we want is contradictory—we want the possibility of failure but don't want anyone to fail, we want winners but no losers, and we want personal agency but don't want to be affected by others' agency Why Utopia Fails – Everything Studies.
4. The Problem of Uniformity vs. Diversity
For a one-size-fits-all ideal to work, every individual would need to be exactly the same in how they think, act, and exist—which can only be achieved through conditioning people against their true nature Can Utopias Exist? Why Achieving A "Perfect Society" Is Actually Impossible. This creates an impossible tension: utopias pose important questions about whether a perfect society would allow for dissent, or whether its perfection would require rigid, perhaps even authoritarian, structure to maintain it Utopias and Dystopias: How Philosophy Imagines a World Beyond Society’s Limitations | by Modern Philosophy 101 | Medium.
5. The Pedagogical Interpretation
Interestingly, some scholars interpret classical utopias, like Plato's Republic, not as actual blueprints for society but as pedagogical tools—useful exercises in moral and political philosophy meant to produce better political philosophers, not better politics Utopianism, Ancient and Modern - Imprimis. The classical view held that utopias existed to elevate philosophical thinking and provide perspective on society's limitations, but were fundamentally academic rather than practical Utopianism, Ancient and Modern - Imprimis.

The philosophical consensus suggests that while the word "utopia" has come to mean paradise in common usage, More's original meaning—"no place"—captures a deeper truth about the impossibility of creating a perfect society Can Utopias Exist? Why Achieving A "Perfect Society" Is Actually Impossible. Rather than being blueprints for actual societies, utopian thinking serves as a critical tool for imagining better possibilities and critiquing existing systems, while recognizing that perfection itself remains fundamentally unattainable.
