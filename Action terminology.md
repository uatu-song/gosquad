## WRITING ACTION WITH THESE TECHNIQUES

### Tips for Ahdia's Voice

**Remember:** Ahdia learned parkour from Firas (who taught her basics before dying), then continued learning from Ruth afterward. She's **not** formally trained in Krav Maga or Judo - her fighting style should feel **scrappier** and more **instinctive**.

**Good approach:**
- Use parkour terms most confidently (she practiced this)
- Krav Maga-style strikes but without formal terminology ("drove her elbow up" not "vertical elbow strike")
- Instinctive grappling without judo names ("twisted his arm behind his back" not "ude garami")
- Reference muscle memory from practice sessions with Ruth
- Mention learning curve: "Ruth taught her this one"

**Example of Ahdia's style:**
```
She vaulted the barrier—Ruth called it a "speed vault" during their sessions—
and landed in a crouch. The guy swung. She ducked, drove her palm into his nose 
(Ruth: "Use your palm, not your fist, you'll break your hand"), and as he staggered 
back, swept his leg. He went down hard.

Not textbook. But it worked.
```

### Mixing Techniques Naturally

**For Ruth (Krav Maga expert):**
- Can use proper terminology in her internal monologue
- Trains others, so would think in technical terms
- "She executed a perfect hadaka jime, forearm across the carotid..."

**For Leah (MMA/Derby fighter):**
- Mix of informal and technical
- "Leah came in with a combination—jab, cross, hook—then shot for the takedown"

**For Firas (flashbacks, parkour-focused):**
- Smooth, efficient language
- "He read the environment like music, every wall a note, every gap a rest"

### Combining with Time Manipulation

**Remember Ahdia's power mechanics:**
- She creates **selective time bubbles** around people/objects
- Person experiences **normal time** inside their bubble
- **Environment** outside bubble is time-dilated
- Creates effects that look like super-speed, super-strength, etc.

**Example narration:**
```
Ruth vaulted toward the gunman—normal speed from her perspective. 
Ahdia held the bubble around her, watched the world crawl. Ruth's precision 
landing placed her exactly where she needed to be. The guard turned 
(so slowly, swimming through molasses) as Ruth's fist came up.

When Ruth's knuckles left the fast-time bubble, they had the force of a 
speeding car.

The guard dropped.

Ruth: "Did I just...?"

Ahdia, nose bleeding: "You did great."
```

### Action Beat Formula

**Setup → Technique → Result → Consequence**

1. **Setup:** Environmental detail, positioning
2. **Technique:** Named or described movement
3. **Result:** Immediate effect
4. **Consequence:** What it costs/enables

**Example:**
```
Setup: The warehouse had exposed beams fifteen feet up.
Technique: She ran at the wall, pushed off (tic-tac), caught the beam.
Result: Her fingers gripped cold metal. Below, three guards spread out.
Consequence: Height advantage, but now they knew where she was.
```

### Pacing Action Scenes

**Fast pace:** Short sentences, technique names, visceral results
```
Speed vault. Land. Roll. Up. The guard reached—she trapped his wrist, 
twisted (Ruth's armbar), drove her knee up. He folded.
```

**Medium pace:** Mix description and technique, show thought
```
She vaulted the railing in one smooth motion—muscle memory from a hundred 
practice sessions. The landing jarred her knees, but she kept moving. 
Had to keep moving.
```

**Slow pace:** Internal monologue, technique as character moment
```
The wall run. Firas taught her this one the week before he died. 
Said it was about trust—trusting your momentum, trusting the physics. 
She ran at the concrete, planted her foot, pushed up.

Flew.

For just a second, she understood what he meant.
```

## QUICK REFERENCE: TECHNIQUE SELECTION

**For quick, efficient movement:** Parkour (vaults, precision, flow)
**For aggressive defense:** Krav Maga (strikes, simultaneous defense/attack)
**For grappling/throws:** Judo (trips, pins, chokes)
**For Ahdia specifically:** Parkour + instinctive Krav Maga-style strikes
**For Ruth:** Krav Maga focused, some parkour mobility
**For Leah:** MMA style (mix of everything, less technical)
**For team coordination:** Each person using their specialty in combination
