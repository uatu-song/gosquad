# Chapter 7: Concerns and Shared Trauma

## Scene 1: Ruth Arrives

Ruth didn't call ahead. She'd learned that trick from years of medicine—unannounced visits showed you what people were really doing, not what they'd cleaned up for company.

Three days since the mob attack. Three days of Ahdia not answering texts. Ruth stood outside the building in the afternoon sun, medical bag in hand, and reminded herself this was just a checkup. Just making sure her friend was okay.

The intercom crackled on the third buzz.

"Yeah?" Ahdia's voice, groggy, surprised.

"It's me. Buzz me up."

Pause. "Ruth?"

"No, it's the other woman who keeps you alive. Yes, Ruth. Open the door."

The lock clicked. Ruth climbed the stairs to the penthouse, grateful for the excuse of exercise rather than elevator silence. Gave her time to organize her thoughts. Team leader mode. Friend mode. Doctor mode. All of them overlapping, none of them quite right.

The apartment door was ajar when she arrived. She pushed it open and stepped into familiar chaos: TV paused mid-show, takeout containers on every surface, the particular clutter that said "person not coping well." Normal for Ahdia.

But something else caught her eye. Treatment equipment on the coffee table—Ryu's portable synthesis setup, vial empty. He'd been here recently. Within the last day or two, judging by the residue.

Ahdia was on the couch, wearing the same clothes Ruth had seen her in three days ago. Hollow-eyed. Exhausted in a way that went beyond normal degradation.

"Hey." Ahdia attempted a casual wave. "Didn't expect company."

"Which is why I didn't call." Ruth set down her medical bag. "How are you doing?"

"Fine. Tired. The usual."

Ruth didn't sit. She stood, assessing. The medical part of her brain was already cataloging: pallor slightly off, micro-tremors in Ahdia's hands, the way she was positioning herself to minimize movement.

"Mind if I check your vitals?"

"What, no small talk first?" Ahdia tried for humor. "Usually doctors at least pretend to care about my weekend plans."

"I do care about your weekend plans. I also care about your cellular integrity. One of those I can measure."

Ahdia sighed but gestured toward the couch. "Fine. Do your thing."

Ruth sat beside her, pulling out her portable scanner—the same tech Ryu used, compact and civilian-approved. She ran it over Ahdia's arm, watching the numbers populate.

The readings made her frown.

"When was your last treatment?"

"Two days ago. Ryu came by."

That tracked with the equipment on the table. But the degradation numbers didn't. Two days post-treatment should show cellular repair still active, not this level of temporal stress.

"Have you been using your powers?"

"Just during the investigation. Chapter 3 stuff." Ahdia's eyes flickered away. "Nothing since."

Ruth filed that away. The numbers said otherwise. But she wasn't ready to push—not yet.

"How are you really doing?" She put away the scanner. "Not the medical answer. The real one."

Ahdia stared at the paused TV screen. Some streaming show Ruth didn't recognize.

"Depressed. Isolated. The usual." She shrugged. "Powers make everything complicated. Can't sleep right. Can't eat right. Can't be around people without exhausting myself. Standard temporal manipulation bullshit."

"And the mob attack?"

Silence.

"I saw the footage," Ahdia said quietly. "Leah got hurt."

"You hacked our patrol cams?"

"I have access through FAERIS." Ahdia finally looked at her. "I should have been there."

"Why weren't you?"

"Treatment. Knocked me out. I slept through—" She stopped. Started again. "I slept through the whole thing. Woke up to forty messages and a blood pressure I didn't want to measure."

Ruth heard the lie. Not a complete lie—depression could absolutely cause that kind of crash. But something was off about how Ahdia said it. Too practiced. Too smooth.

She let it go. For now.

"The team misses you."

"I know."

"We can't keep covering your absences forever."

"I know that too."

"Then what's the plan, Ahdia?"

Ahdia laughed, hollow. "Plan? Ruth, I'm barely functioning. I get up, I watch TV, I try not to use my powers for anything because every second I freeze costs me something. I don't have a plan. I have a slow degradation curve and a lot of streaming services."

Ruth felt the conversation shifting. Ahdia was being honest about the depression—that part wasn't an act. The exhaustion was real. The isolation was real.

But something else was happening too. Something Ruth couldn't quite name.

"I miss him," Ruth said.

Ahdia blinked. "What?"

"Firas. The mob attack..." Ruth heard her own voice crack slightly. "It reminded me of the night we lost him. Being helpless. Knowing I couldn't protect everyone."

"Ruth—"

"I'm the team leader now. I make the calls. I decide who goes where, who does what. And when they get hurt—when Leah's bleeding because I didn't pull out fast enough—that's on me."

Ahdia was quiet. Listening. Not trying to fix it.

"He was going to propose," Ruth said. "Did I tell you that? After the singularity mission. He had a ring. Victor found it when we cleaned out his locker."

"You didn't tell me."

"Couldn't. Can't, usually." Ruth stared at the floor. "But here, with you... I don't know. It feels safer."

"Because I'm not going to judge you for falling apart?"

"Because you already know what falling apart looks like."

Something passed between them. Two women who'd lost too much. Two friends carrying weight they couldn't share with anyone else.

"I think about my parents sometimes," Ahdia said quietly. "Montana. Before everything went wrong."

Ruth knew the story. Knew more than she'd ever told Ahdia she knew—CADENS files were thorough.

"Losing them made me stop trusting people," Ahdia continued. "Can't lose someone if you never let them close, right? Hermit mode. TV and isolation and pretending the world doesn't exist."

"But you let the team in."

"Did I?" Ahdia looked genuinely uncertain. "Sometimes I think I'm just... performing connection. Doing what a person who has friends would do. Faking it."

"That's depression talking."

"Is it? How do you tell the difference?"

Ruth didn't have an answer. She reached over and took Ahdia's hand instead.

"We're not performing," Ruth said. "This, right now? This is real. I came because I was worried. You're listening because you care. That's not fake."

Ahdia squeezed her hand. Said nothing.

"Whatever's going on with you," Ruth continued, "whatever's making those numbers worse than they should be—you can tell me. When you're ready."

Ahdia's jaw tightened. For a moment, Ruth thought she might actually open up.

Then: "It's just the depression. I promise."

Lie. Ruth felt it.

But she let it go.

"Okay." She released Ahdia's hand. "Since I'm here, want me to top off your treatment? Might as well take advantage of the house call."

Ahdia nodded, relief visible. "Yeah. That'd be good."

Ruth set up the portable synthesis equipment on the coffee table, same spot Ryu's had occupied. Prepared the injection with practiced efficiency.

Ahdia rolled up her sleeve. The injection site was familiar, slightly bruised from recent treatments.

The cold spread first, then warmth. Cellular repair accelerating. Ruth watched the readout improve, but not as much as it should have.

"I'm here," Ruth said as she worked. "Any time. Day or night. You call, I come."

"I know."

"Do you? Because you didn't call after the mob attack. You didn't answer when I called."

"I was—"

"Sleeping. I know." Ruth met her eyes. "Just... reach out, okay? Before it gets worse. Not after."

Ahdia nodded. Something that might have been guilt flickered across her face.

"I promise."

Another lie. Ruth heard it clearly this time.

She finished the treatment, packed up her equipment, stood to leave. At the door, she turned back.

"I love you, you know. Not romantically. But you're important to me. You matter."

Ahdia's expression cracked, just for a moment. Real emotion underneath all the deflection.

"You matter to me too."

Ruth left.

In the hallway, she let her professional mask drop. The numbers didn't add up. The evasions were too practiced. Something was happening with Ahdia that went beyond depression.

She'd check with Ryu tomorrow. Compare notes.

For now, she'd trust. But she'd verify.

## Scene 2: Parallel Isolation

Ahdia sat on the couch after Ruth left.

The treatment vial was still on the table. Ruth's care made physical. The woman who kept her alive, who showed up without being asked, who noticed when the numbers didn't match.

And Ahdia had lied to her face.

*Jakarta saved 11,000 lives.*

That's what she told herself. The math that justified everything. The arms shipment she'd stopped, the massacre she'd prevented, the people walking around right now who would have been dead if she'd stayed home.

Ruth couldn't know. Would try to stop her. Medical concerns, team concerns, whatever. Ruth would see the degradation numbers and panic, and then Ahdia would be confined to approved operations only, and thousands of people would die because she wasn't there.

*She'd understand if she knew.*

Would she?

Or would she see a friend spiraling? Making dangerous choices? Burning herself down for a hero complex that couldn't be sustained?

Ahdia pulled up her laptop. The news ticker showed something about a diplomatic crisis averted in Southeast Asia. Officials declining to comment. No connection to a woman in Caledonia who'd spent forty minutes frozen in time, reading documents she shouldn't have access to.

*They wouldn't understand. They'd try to stop me.*

The justification felt hollow with Ruth's words still echoing.

*Any time. Day or night. You call, I come.*

She closed the laptop. Sat in the dark.

The Hyper Seed was cold. Always cold now.

Her phone buzzed. Text from Ryu: *Intel briefing tomorrow. New intercepts.*

The cycle continuing. Information leading to crisis leading to intervention leading to lies.

She typed back: *I'll be ready.*

Closed her eyes.

Somewhere across the city, Ruth was going home to an empty apartment where Firas used to live. Carrying her own grief. Wondering what was wrong with her friend.

Both of them alone.

Both of them carrying secrets.

Both of them doing what they thought was right.
