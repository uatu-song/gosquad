# Chapter 8: The First Line Crossed Again

## Scene 1: Routine Treatment

Month 2. One week after Ruth's visit.

Ahdia's apartment was slightly messier than before—dishes piling up, clothes on floors, the particular entropy of someone not coping well. Ryu noticed but didn't comment when she let him in.

"How are you feeling?" Professional question, standard opening.

"Exhausted. The usual."

He set up his equipment on the coffee table, same spot Ruth had used. Same spot it always occupied these days.

"Degradation rate's elevated." He studied the scanner readout. "More than I'd expect for normal daily function."

"Investigation last week. Geneva stuff." Not entirely a lie.

Ryu accepted this. Maybe he knew the real answer. Maybe he didn't want to know.

The treatment was routine now—inject, monitor, wait. Cold spreading through her bloodstream, then warmth. Cellular repair accelerating. The familiar rhythm of staying alive.

"CADENS has been busy," Ryu said while monitoring. Making small talk.

"Yeah?"

"Intelligence intercepts. More than usual." He adjusted a setting. "Interesting patterns showing up."

Ahdia felt her attention sharpen. Tried to hide it.

"What kind of patterns?"

"Arms shipment routing through Eastern Europe. Destination's a conflict zone—ethnic tensions, historical grievances, the usual powder keg." He kept his voice neutral. "Pattern suggests massacre planning. Similar signature to past genocides."

"That's..." Ahdia stopped herself. "That's terrible."

"CADENS is monitoring, but it's outside jurisdiction. Can't intervene without authorization from seven different agencies."

"So people are going to die."

"Probably." He said it flat. Frustrated. "Thousands, if the intelligence is accurate. And there's nothing anyone can do about it."

The words hung there.

Nothing anyone can do.

Except.

"Do you have coordinates?" Ahdia heard herself ask.

Ryu paused. The scanner beeped. Treatment completing.

"Why would you need coordinates?"

"Just... curious. Where it is."

He looked at her for a long moment. She could see the calculation happening—what she was really asking, what he would really be agreeing to.

"Translocation coordinates are restricted," he said carefully.

"But you have access."

"I have access."

Neither of them spoke. The scanner beeped again. Numbers normalizing.

"I could send you the intelligence file," Ryu said finally. "For reference purposes. Information only."

"That would be helpful."

"What you do with information is your own choice."

"Of course."

The line crossed. No ceremony, no acknowledgment. Just two people pretending they weren't conspiring.

Ryu packed up his equipment. Mentioned the fusion project the government was pressuring CADENS to support—Kain's campaign promise, ten-month timeline that scientists said was impossible. Type I civilization rhetoric. Stellarator prototype.

"Fusion is good technology," he said. "But this implementation..." He shook his head. "Rushing something that dangerous for political optics."

"Sounds like Kain."

"Sounds like a lot of people."

He left. Mentioned he'd send the file that evening. Information only.

Ahdia sat on the couch with her phone.

Three hours later, coordinates in her inbox. Everything she needed.

## Scene 2: The Intervention

Forty-eight hours later.

Ahdia returned to her apartment via translocation, barely able to stand.

The mission had worked. Arms shipment intercepted by local authorities, evidence staged, leaders confronted with proof they couldn't explain away. Massacre prevented. Eight thousand people who would never know how close they'd come.

Cost: Everything.

She collapsed on the couch, hollow-eyed, shaking. Cellular degradation screaming through every nerve. The Hyper Seed pulsing weak and cold.

Her phone showed missed calls. Ruth. Victor. Group chat scrolling with messages.

Can't answer. Can barely move.

The news was playing on the TV she'd left running—diplomatic crisis averted, ethnic tensions cooling, officials declining to comment. Perfect. No fingerprints. No connection to her.

Eight thousand lives.

Twenty percent cellular integrity, burned in a single operation.

The math seemed justified. That was the trap.

## Scene 3: Emergency Treatment

Doorbell.

Ryu, unscheduled. He knew she'd need help.

She let him in. Barely made it to the door.

"Jesus." He saw her state immediately. Set up emergency equipment without being asked.

Scanner readings: 52% cellular integrity. Critical. She'd been at 73% two days ago.

Neither of them discussed why.

Emergency synthesis compound, stronger than standard. The injection burned going in. Stabilization slow, painful, incomplete.

"I'm going to falsify this in the records," Ryu said while monitoring. "Routine treatment, normal degradation rate."

Ahdia nodded. What else could she do?

"Ruth can't know about this. These numbers would raise questions."

"I understand."

"I'll report steady degradation consistent with approved power use."

First explicit falsification. Professional ethics shattered.

"Thank you."

Ryu finished packing his equipment. Stopped at the door.

"Another intercept came through today. Humanitarian crisis forming. I don't have coordinates yet."

Ahdia looked at him. Exhausted. Broken. Somehow still hungry for the next crisis.

"Let me know when you do."

He left.

The cycle established. Intel, intervention, treatment, lies, repeat.

Months of this ahead.

## Scene 4: The Pattern

Ahdia alone with the TV.

News coverage showing the Eastern Europe crisis averted. Diplomatic breakthrough. Peace preserved.

Eight thousand people who would never know.

She opened Ruth's text: *Checking in, everything okay?*

Typed back: *Rough couple days. Depression bad. Sorry for silence.*

Not entirely a lie. Depression was real. Just not the cause.

Ruth responded with support. Offered to visit.

Ahdia declined. Needed rest. Would see her at next team meeting.

The lies accumulating. Friendship eroding with each deception.

But eight thousand lives.

She closed her eyes. Let the justification hold her together.

The pattern would run for seven more months. Treatment every few weeks, falsified records, global interventions hidden from the team. Thousands saved. Cellular integrity dropping. Ruth's suspicion growing.

Month 8, everything would break.

But for now, the math still worked.

Eight thousand lives.

Twenty percent degradation.

Worth it.

Had to be worth it.
