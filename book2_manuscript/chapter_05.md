# Chapter 5: Where Is Ahdia?

## Scene 1: Pre-Patrol Briefing

The command center hummed with its usual low-grade anxiety.

Screens tracked news feeds—Kain's campaign ads, protests in three cities, the latest polling that showed enhanced individuals as "the greatest threat to American safety" according to 47% of respondents. FAERIS drones ran pre-flight checks in the corner, their lights blinking in sequence. The smell of recycled air and too much coffee hung over everything.

Ruth stood at the holo-map, tracing their patrol route through downtown Caledonia. Six blocks. Routine presence. Show the community that enhanced individuals weren't the monsters Kain's campaign claimed.

"Is Ahdia meeting us there, or...?"

Victor's question hung in the air. Ruth checked her comm. The message had come in an hour ago.

"She said she'd catch up. Treatment ran long."

"That's the third time this week." Tess kept her voice low, but Korede heard it anyway. He shrugged—he didn't know Ahdia well enough to judge. Hadn't seen her at full strength, didn't understand what "treatment" meant or what it cost. To him, she was just the time-freezer who sometimes wasn't there.

"We've done patrols without her before." Ben was already checking his equipment. "FAERIS is still functional."

"Right." Ruth nodded, but something felt off. A tightness in her chest that had started appearing whenever Ahdia's name came up. The absences were getting longer. The excuses were getting thinner. "Let's go over the parameters."

She pulled up the route on the holo-map. "Objective: Community presence. After Geneva, after the riots, people are nervous about enhanced individuals. We show them we're safe."

"Are we though?" Leah's voice was smaller than usual. "Safe?"

"We're on their side." Victor said it like a fact, because to him it was. "That's what matters."

"Tell that to the news coverage." Tess gestured at one of the screens. "We're 'dangerous vigilantes' this week."

"Which is why we're doing this." Ruth enlarged the patrol route. "Show up, be visible, be helpful. No confrontations. No power displays. Just presence."

Ryu's voice crackled over comms. "FAERIS diagnostics complete. All drones operational."

"Even without Ahdia directing them?"

"They've been developing autonomous support patterns. Should maintain effectiveness."

The team didn't realize what that meant—that the drones were working independently now, making their own decisions about when and how to help. FAERIS was evolving. Ten percent autonomous and growing.

Ruth looked at the empty chair where Ahdia usually sat during briefings. *Treatment ran long.* The same excuse, different day.

"Good. Let's move out."

## Scene 2: The Shift

The first few blocks felt almost normal.

Pedestrians recognized them, waved, took photos. A woman in a Geneva Windrow campaign shirt gave them a thumbs up. A kid asked Ben if he was really a sniper.

"Not tonight. Tonight I'm just walking."

"That's less cool."

Ben almost smiled. "Yeah. It is."

Victor fell into step beside a man he recognized from the community center—brief handshake, quick conversation about the memorial service planning. This was what they'd come for. Connection. Presence. Proof that enhanced individuals were people too.

Then they crossed into the next block.

"Is it just me, or did the vibe just... change?" Leah looked around, shoulders tensing.

The pedestrian traffic thinned. People who'd been walking toward them suddenly found reasons to cross the street. Eye contact vanished. A woman pulled her child closer and hurried past without looking.

"No hostile signatures." Ben was already scanning. "No threats detected."

But people were definitely avoiding them.

FAERIS chimed an alert in Ruth's earpiece. *"EM anomaly detected. Localized, faint signature. Unknown origin."*

"Ryu, are you seeing this?"

"Confirmed." His voice was careful over comms. "Unknown energy pattern. Not cataclysm-derived, but... unusual."

The pattern was subtle—easy to miss if you weren't looking. But something was affecting the area around the Go Squad. Making people afraid.

"What IS that?" Victor watched a couple practically run to avoid passing them. "People are acting like we're contagious."

Ruth's HUD displayed the analysis. Fear response amplification. Fifty-meter radius. Centered on their position.

Something was making people afraid of them.

They approached a corner. Ruth saw a familiar face—young woman, early twenties, phone in hand. The same civilian who'd wanted a selfie with "real heroes" last month after they'd stopped that thing at the park.

"Hey!" Victor recognized her too. "You're the one who wanted the selfie, right? After the thing at the park?"

The woman froze. Last month, she'd been excited. Starstruck. Asked Victor to pose while she took a dozen photos.

Now she backed away, fear visible in every line of her body.

"It's okay, we're just—"

"Stay away from me."

"What? We met before. You were excited—"

"That was before." Her voice was rising. "Before Geneva died. Before... just stay back!"

She turned and hurried away, nearly running.

The team stood frozen. Same person. Same street. Completely different reaction.

"What the hell just happened?" Tess stared after her.

"EM signature spiked when she saw us." Ben checked his scanner. "Ryu, confirm?"

"Confirmed. Pattern intensified during interaction. It's affecting emotional response."

"You're saying something's making people afraid of us?"

"Not making them afraid." Ruth felt the pieces clicking together. "Amplifying existing fear."

"But she wasn't afraid of us last month. She wanted a photo!"

"Last month, Geneva was alive. Media wasn't calling us dangerous." Ruth watched more pedestrians notice them, watched the fear spread. "This thing—whatever it is—takes existing fear and cranks it to eleven."

More people were backing away. Pulling out phones. Whispering to each other.

"We should leave." Korede's voice was quiet. "We're making it worse."

---

## Scene 3: The Flash Mob

Ruth made the call to stay. Running would prove whatever-it-was right. They were supposed to be community presence.

Ten minutes later, she wasn't sure that had been the right decision.

The crowd had grown. Thirty people, maybe forty. Whispers spreading faster than the team could move.

"They're here. The ones Geneva defended before she died."

"She died BECAUSE of them. They brought this on us."

"Dangerous freaks. Shouldn't be allowed in our neighborhood."

The fear was turning to anger. Ruth could see it in their postures—shoulders forward, fists clenching. The EM signature was screaming in her earpiece. Two hundred percent of baseline.

"This is a mob." Victor's voice was flat, recognizing the pattern. "This is a lynch mob forming."

"Everyone stay calm. Defensive postures only."

The first bottle came from somewhere in the back of the crowd. It shattered near Ben's feet.

"We don't engage." Ben kept his voice level on the comm. "Defensive only."

More objects followed. Rocks. Cans. Someone's shoe. A piece of pipe.

"They're actually attacking us!" Leah ducked as a rock sailed past her head.

"Shields up. FAERIS, defensive perimeter only."

The drones formed a barrier, deflecting projectiles without attacking. But the crowd kept pressing forward, fear-fueled rage making reason impossible.

"We can't fight civilians." Tess was furious, but holding back. "That's exactly what this WANTS."

"Whoever's doing this wants us to prove we're dangerous."

"Well they're doing a great job, because I feel pretty dangerous right now!" Victor blocked a thrown bottle with his forearm.

Someone grabbed Korede's arm, trying to pull him from formation. Tess yanked him back, shoving the civilian away—defensive, not aggressive.

The crowd erupted.

"SEE! THEY'RE VIOLENT!"

Perfect. Turn defense into proof of danger. Whatever was amplifying their fear knew exactly what it was doing.

"Fall back. Now. FAERIS, cover retreat."

"If Ahdia were here, she could freeze them. Get us out clean."

Victor's response was sharp. "Well she's NOT here. We work with what we have."

They retreated toward an alley, FAERIS drones forming a screen. The projectiles were getting more dangerous—metal, glass, someone had a length of rebar.

A rock caught Leah on the forehead. Blood ran down into her eye.

"I'm bleeding—"

"Keep moving. Don't stop."

Ruth's voice was steady even as her heart pounded. "Ryu, we need extraction. Translocation to CADENS. Now."

"Coordinates locked. Thirty seconds."

Thirty seconds felt like thirty years. The mob reached the alley entrance. Someone swung a pipe at Ben. He blocked it—defensive, didn't strike back—but took the hit on his forearm.

"They're going to kill us—" Korede's voice was rising.

"No." Victor's wasn't. "They're scared. Being MADE scared. Not their fault."

The translocation activated. Blue flash. The team disappeared.

The mob stood in the empty alley, confused, the EM signature fading. Whatever had gripped them was passing. People looked at each other, at their own hands, at the blood on the concrete.

"What... what happened?"

None of them would remember why they'd attacked. None of them would understand.

## Scene 4: Eidolon Named

The medical bay smelled like antiseptic and failure.

Leah's forehead was stitched. Ben's ribs were bruised. Everyone had scrapes, cuts, the kind of minor injuries that felt major when civilians inflicted them.

"We got attacked by CIVILIANS." Tess was pacing, furious. "Regular people with rocks and bottles."

"They wanted to kill us." Leah was still shaking. "I saw it in their eyes."

"They were terrified." Victor was sitting in a chair, staring at nothing. "Something made them terrified of us."

Director Bourn entered, her presence filling the room the way it always did. Power recognizing wounded power.

"Not just amplification." Her voice was calm. "Targeted emotional manipulation."

Ruth looked up. "You know what this is?"

"We've been tracking similar patterns. Different cities, always targeting enhanced individuals. Someone's making people's existing fears unbearable."

"Who?" Ben demanded. "What are we dealing with?"

"We don't know yet. But it's organized, intelligent, and escalating."

Ryu pulled up data on the main screen. "Energy signature doesn't match known cataclysm artifacts. But the pattern matches something from Conclave archives."

"Fear manipulation entities." Bourn studied the data. "Rare. Extremely dangerous."

"Entities?" Ruth felt cold. "As in... alive?"

"Sentient. Feeds on fear, amplifies fear, creates feedback loops."

"So a fear monster." Tess stopped pacing. "Great. Just what we needed."

"Conclave designation: Eidolon. Fear-class entity."

"Eidolon?" Leah looked confused. "Like... a ghost?"

"Greek." Victor's voice was hollow. "An idealized phantom. Something that haunts based on perception."

"How do we fight something that makes people afraid of us?" Ruth was already running scenarios. None of them worked.

"That's the problem." Bourn's face showed nothing. "Traditional tactics won't work. Every action you take, it'll twist into proof you're dangerous."

"So we're in an impossible situation."

"Exactly."

Silence settled over the medical bay. The team had faced enhanced criminals, cosmic artifacts, a kaiju. But an enemy that turned regular people into weapons? That made your existence proof of your danger?

"We need everyone on this." Ruth's exhaustion bled through. "Full team assessment."

"Where IS Ahdia, anyway?" Tess crossed her arms. "We could've used her out there."

"Treatment. She'll be back soon."

"Treatment's been taking longer lately." Victor's eyes met Ruth's. "You notice that?"

"Cellular degradation varies. Sometimes it takes time."

"But we could have REALLY used her." Leah touched the fresh stitches on her forehead. "Time freeze, get us out clean."

"Instead we got beat up by scared civilians and ran away." Ben's voice was flat.

"We made the right call." Ruth heard the snap in her own voice. "Fighting would've proven Eidolon right."

"I know." Tess's anger deflated. "But it sucks that she wasn't there."

Korede spoke for the first time since they'd arrived. "Where was she, though? Really?"

Everyone looked at Ruth.

"I'll check on her. Make sure she's okay."

The words sounded hollow, even to her.

---

## Scene 5: Parallel Isolation

Ruth checked her phone again. Six missed calls. Fifteen messages in the team chat. Nothing from Ahdia.

"She's probably just resting. I'll check on her tomorrow."

"Want company?" Victor offered. "I can swing by—"

"No. I'll handle it. She... she might need space."

"Space from what?" Tess was still raw from the fight. "We're her team."

"Just trust me. I'll make sure she's okay."

The team dispersed, exhausted, processing their first Eidolon encounter. None of them knew what their hero was really doing.

---

Ahdia's apartment was dark.

She sat on the couch, hollow-eyed, sweating despite the cold. Ryu's equipment was still on the coffee table—the vial empty, the treatment administered hours ago.

Her phone showed the missed calls. Ruth. Victor. The group chat scrolling with messages she couldn't answer.

"I can't. Not yet."

On her laptop, patrol cam footage played on loop. The mob attack. Leah's blood. The team retreating.

She'd watched it three times.

*I should have been there.*

But she couldn't have been. Not without revealing where she'd actually gone. What she'd actually done.

The news ticker at the bottom of her screen showed something about an arms deal falling through in Southeast Asia. Inexplicable evidence discovery. Officials declining to comment.

Nobody would connect that to the woman sitting alone in a Caledonia penthouse.

"They wouldn't understand." She said it to the empty room. "They'd try to stop me."

She closed the laptop. Sat in the dark. The Hyper Seed in her chest was cold—always cold now, after what she'd burned to get home in time to not answer their calls.

Somewhere across the city, the team was together. Processing. Healing.

Ahdia was alone with a secret she couldn't share.

---

On the rooftop across the street, a figure stood in shadow, watching the window where Ahdia's light had just gone out.

She looked like Ahdia. Older. Tired in ways that had nothing to do with sleep.

"I did the same thing." Her voice was barely a whisper. "It doesn't work. It never works."

She turned to leave. Paused.

"But you won't listen until you've failed completely. None of us do."

She disappeared. Translocation, time power, something else—impossible to tell.

The window stayed dark.

## Scene 6: Isaiah Bennett

Morning after the mob attack. The team had gathered at the safe house, still bruised, still processing. Someone turned on the news.

"Breaking: Grand jury decision in the Isaiah Bennett case..."

Ruth turned up the volume. The screen showed courthouse steps, a prosecutor at a podium, cameras flashing.

"After thorough review, the grand jury declines to indict Officer Marcus Webb in the death of Isaiah Bennett."

Silence.

"Insufficient evidence to establish criminal intent beyond reasonable doubt."

"Insufficient evidence?" Victor's voice was quiet fury. "He shot an unarmed man at a peaceful protest."

"We have the body cam footage." Ben was gripping the arm of his chair. "Webb identified him as non-threat before shooting."

"Evidence doesn't matter if the system won't use it."

The screen cut to the courthouse steps. Isaiah's mother emerging, face devastated, community supporters surrounding her.

"They killed my son. We showed them the footage. We showed them the witnesses. We showed them Isaiah's engineering research—the truth he died trying to tell. And they said it wasn't enough."

She broke down. Her daughter, Kiana, supported her.

"What more could he have done? How was he supposed to survive being Black and right?"

In the safe house, the team watched in heavy silence. Then the screen cut to a police union press conference. Officer Marcus Webb at the podium—white, mid-thirties, tactical unit.

"Grateful for the thorough investigation. Difficult circumstances. I feared for my life."

Killed unarmed Black man, calling it protocol.

"Officer Webb will return to active duty next week."

"They're putting him back on streets." Ben's voice was disbelieving. "Armed. Cleared."

"With the community knowing he killed Isaiah and walked away."

"That's the point." Victor understood it. "Show them the system protects cops who kill activists."

Ruth made the connection. "Yesterday, we were attacked by civilians made afraid of us. Today, a cop who killed a civilian walks free because he was 'afraid.'"

"Both justified by fear." Ben saw it too. "Both protected by systems."

"Eidolon amplified fear of US. But fear of THEM?" Victor gestured at Webb on screen. "System amplifies that itself. No entity needed."

Tess hadn't spoken. She was staring at the screen where her father—Chief Whitford—was giving his statement.

"Difficult decision. Officer followed protocol. Tragic but necessary."

"That's my father." Her voice was hollow. "His department. His statement."

"Tess—" Victor started.

"Don't. I know what you're going to say. 'Not your fault.' 'You're not him.' But it IS his department. He CHOSE to protect Webb."

Her phone buzzed. Leta calling.

Tess stepped away from the group, answered.

"Are you okay? I saw the news. Webb walked?"

"Yeah. My dad's department. He protected him."

"Tess, I'm so sorry—"

"Don't be sorry. Be careful."

"What?"

"Webb is back on duty. Community knows he killed Isaiah. You're visible. Trans activist. Sex worker organizer. You organize protests." Tess's voice cracked. "You're everything they target."

"I'm not stopping because one cop—"

"One cop who KILLED someone like you and walked free!"

"Isaiah wasn't trans—"

"Isaiah was vulnerable and visible and RIGHT. Just like you. Webb killed him. System said it was fine. Webb is still out there."

Pause on the line.

"I'll be careful. I promise."

"Please. I love you. I need you to be safe."

"I love you too. I'll be safe."

The call ended. Tess stood apart from the team, phone in her hand, fear in her chest that she couldn't explain.

Korede was watching her. He didn't know yet that Tess was his sister's girlfriend. Didn't know the weight of what he'd just witnessed.

But he noticed: Tess was terrified for someone.

---

Final montage. Parallel systems.

Officer Marcus Webb walking out of the courthouse. Free. Badge and gun returned.

Isaiah's family grieving on the steps. Justice denied.

Go Squad in the safe house. Still hurt from the mob. Now watching the system declare itself.

Ahdia in her apartment. Isolated. News coverage playing without sound.

And somewhere unseen, Eidolon. Amplifying fear across the city.

*We can't save everyone.*

*But we try anyway.*

Final image: Officer Marcus Webb in uniform. Back on patrol. Weapon holstered. Waiting.

**Title card: 9 months until Leta's death.**

*End Chapter 5*
