# Chapter 3: The Gaps

## Scene 1: Team Debrief

The penthouse felt different in daylight. Smaller, somehow.

Ahdia had watched from this same couch as Geneva Windrow's head exploded on live television, and now here she was, eighteen hours later, watching Ruth pace in front of the windows like a general without a map. The bloodstain was still on her shirt from where she'd tried to apply pressure to a wound that didn't exist anymore. Nobody had told her to change. Nobody had changed.

The team had arranged themselves around the living room—Ben by the kitchen counter, Tess cross-legged on the floor with her laptop, Victor and Leah sharing the loveseat. Coffee cups held like weapons. Eyes that had forgotten how to close.

Ahdia pulled her knees up to her chest. The Hyper Seed felt cold against her sternum—colder than usual, like it was sulking. Three minutes frozen yesterday. Three minutes where she'd stood in stopped time, staring at a woman whose brain was already scattered across a stage, trying to figure out what she was supposed to do with a corpse that couldn't be un-corpsed.

*Time manipulation doesn't work on dead people.*

She'd learned that. Added it to the list of things her powers couldn't fix.

"Alright." Ruth's voice cut through the fog—calm, clipped, the triage voice she used when falling apart wasn't an option. "What do we know?"

Ben straightened from his lean against the counter. Former military intelligence, which meant he delivered information like he was briefing a general instead of a bunch of exhausted vigilantes in an apartment that smelled like cold pizza and despair.

"Sniper nest on the parking structure. Roof access through a standard maintenance hatch—no forced entry. Someone had the codes or the skills." He pulled up something on his phone, projected it to the wall screen. "Dust circle on the gravel. Tripod imprint. Spent brass, 7.62 NATO."

"Long range," Tess said without looking up from her laptop.

"Eight hundred meters, moving target, headshot." Ben's jaw tightened. "Expert level. Military or equivalent. But that's not the interesting part."

Ahdia watched him weighing what to say next. Ben was careful with information—doled it out in pieces, let you build the picture yourself. Old habit from intelligence work, probably. Or maybe he just didn't trust anyone to handle the full picture at once.

"My ears were ringing when I got there," he said. "Ozone smell. Like after a lightning strike."

Ruth stopped pacing. "Translocation signature."

"That's my guess. The shooter was there, took the shot, and then—" Ben made a gesture like smoke dispersing. "Gone. No egress route, no witnesses, no trace except the brass and the smell."

"Can you trace it?" Victor asked.

"Not without CADENS access logs. They track translocation signatures globally—who's authorized, when it's deployed, where it pings. If someone used their tech, or something like it, they'd have records." Ben's expression went flat. "But we're not exactly on the Christmas card list."

"We're contractors," Ruth said. "Not family."

"Right."

Tess looked up from her laptop. Something in her face had shifted—the look she got when she'd found a thread worth pulling.

"I found something too. The bot network that pushed the 'radical elements' narrative?"

Victor leaned forward. "What about it?"

"It pivoted in under a minute. Geneva gets shot at 7:23. By 7:24, thousands of accounts are pushing the same message—'domestic terrorism,' 'radical elements,' 'this is what happens.' Coordinated. Simultaneous."

Silence. Leah's coffee cup stopped halfway to her mouth.

"One minute?" she said.

"One minute to pivot thousands of accounts to a message about something that just happened." Tess turned her laptop so they could see the timestamps. "That's not reactive. That's infrastructure. Someone built a machine designed to exploit any crisis—sitting ready, waiting for something to weaponize."

"So the bots and the shooter..." Victor started.

"Might not be the same operation," Tess finished. "The bot network was already running fear narratives about the memorial before anyone died. 'Radical elements gathering.' 'Potential violence.' Priming the audience. When Geneva went down, they just... pivoted."

"Which means someone's spent serious money building this," Ruth said.

"Yeah. But the funding trail dead-ends at shell companies. I need financial forensics I can't do from my laptop."

Ruth had stopped pacing. Ahdia could see her calculating—resources, risks, trust. The same look she'd had in the ER, probably, when three trauma patients came in at once and she had to decide who got the surgeon first.

"So we have: professional sniper, translocation tech, and a pre-positioned narrative." Ruth's voice was steady, but her hands weren't. "This wasn't random violence. This was an operation."

"And we can't trace any of it," Ben said, "without access we don't have."

"We're not going to CADENS with this." Ruth's tone left no room for argument. "Not yet. Not until we know more about what we're dealing with."

"Then how do we—"

"We investigate quietly. We use what we have. We don't tip anyone off that we're looking."

Ahdia sat on the couch through all of it. Watching. Listening. Her body felt like it belonged to someone else—heavy, distant, wrong in ways she couldn't name. But her brain was doing something it hadn't done in months.

It was paying attention.

Ben needed CADENS access logs. Tess needed financial forensics. They were hitting walls she couldn't climb, couldn't freeze, couldn't punch through with time manipulation or purple lightning or any of the other cosmic bullshit that had taken over her life.

But Ryu was coming later. For treatment.

And Ryu worked for CADENS.

"Ahdia." Victor's voice, gentle. "You okay?"

She looked up. Everyone was looking at her. She hadn't said anything in—how long? Ten minutes? Twenty?

"Fine," she said. "Just tired."

"You should rest." Ruth's concern was real but practical—the kind that came with a checklist attached. "Ryu's coming later for treatment."

"I know."

She didn't move. Didn't offer to help with the investigation. Didn't make a TV reference or a dark joke or any of the other deflections she usually used to fill space.

Just sat there, heavy and wrong, while her brain kept turning over what she'd heard.

Ben needed translocation logs.
Tess needed financial access.
Ryu had both.

## Scene 2: Treatment

The doorbell was the first sound Ahdia had registered in hours.

She'd been watching CNN with the sound off—talking heads discussing Geneva's "legacy," which apparently meant arguing about whether she'd been too radical or not radical enough. Nobody on screen seemed to remember she'd been a person twenty-four hours ago. A person who'd stayed three hours in a grieving mother's apartment because she couldn't make herself leave. A person who'd held hands and looked at model trains and meant it.

Now she was a talking point. A symbol. A cautionary tale about what happened to women who spoke too loud.

Ahdia pulled herself off the couch. Every joint ached—the deep-tissue exhaustion that came from burning frozen time. The Hyper Seed felt like a cold stone lodged behind her sternum.

She opened the door.

Ryu stood there with a medical case that probably cost more than her first car. He was younger than she'd expected when they'd first met—late twenties, maybe early thirties, with the kind of face that looked perpetually concerned. Like he'd come out of the womb worried about someone's cellular integrity.

"Ms. Bacchus."

"You can call me Ahdia. You've seen my cellular integrity numbers. We're past formalities."

He smiled—small, careful, like he wasn't sure if smiling was allowed. "Fair enough. How are you feeling?"

"Like I watched someone's head explode on live TV and then couldn't do anything about it."

Ryu paused in the doorway. Set down his case. Something in his expression shifted—not pity, exactly. Recognition.

"That's... a lot."

"It's fine. I'm fine. Everything's fine."

Neither of them believed it. She stepped aside to let him in.

Ryu surveyed the apartment as he set up—TV paused on a frozen news anchor, takeout containers stacked on the counter, evidence of someone who hadn't left these rooms in days. He didn't comment. Just pulled equipment from his case with the practiced efficiency of someone who'd done this dozens of times.

"Where would you be most comfortable?"

Ahdia gestured at the couch. "This is basically my entire life, so."

"Do I sit or lie down? I've only seen this in medical dramas. Grey's Anatomy. House. That one where the doctors are also ghosts."

"Sitting is fine." Ryu began arranging instruments on the coffee table—portable synthesis device, scanner, vials that glowed faintly in ways she'd learned not to ask about. "This will take approximately twenty minutes. First scan, then injection, then monitoring."

"That's a lot more sci-fi than I expected."

"Dr. Carter's breakthrough required adapting isotope delivery systems. Quite elegant, actually."

Ahdia noticed: Ryu respected Ruth's work. That mattered, somehow.

He ran the scanner over her chest. The Hyper Seed registered on his display as a cold spot on the thermal, surrounded by stress markers she couldn't read but knew weren't good.

"Baseline at 71%," Ryu said. "Down from 78% last week."

"The riot. The assassination. I burned a lot."

"You burned fifty minutes in three days."

"People were dying."

"I'm not criticizing." His voice was careful, precise. "Just noting. Each use costs lifespan. Therefore, each use requires justification."

"I helped investigate an assassination—"

"And burned through 7% cellular integrity for information gathering that conventional analysis could have achieved."

Ahdia felt the hit land. He wasn't wrong. She'd frozen time at the crime scene to look at things she could have looked at in normal time. Habit from training. The instinct to use the power because she had it.

"Your HUD functions in normal time," Ryu continued. "Thermal overlay, electromagnetic scanning, trajectory mapping—all without temporal manipulation."

"So I'm wasting my life. Cool. Thanks for the update."

"I'm trying to help you understand the economics." He prepared the injection—clear liquid in a syringe that caught the light wrong. "Dr. Carter and I can extend your timeline. But you determine how much timeline we have to work with."

"Okay, so, this is like... *Crank*? The Jason Statham movie?"

Ryu's hands paused. "I'm not familiar."

"Guy has to keep his adrenaline up or his heart stops. Except mine is 'use powers less or cells stop.'"

"That's somewhat reductive but not entirely inaccurate."

"Wait, you HAVE seen it?"

A slight smile crossed his face. "I reviewed your media consumption history. Contextual understanding aids communication."

Ahdia stared at him. "You studied how I talk?"

"I studied how you think. You process reality through narrative frameworks. Television, films, genre conventions. It's not ineffective, merely... indirect."

She wasn't sure if she should be touched or creeped out. Landed somewhere in the middle.

Ryu held up the syringe. "This will feel cold. Then warm. Then nothing."

The needle entered her arm. Cold spreading through her bloodstream—foreign, synthetic, not quite pain but not quite anything else either. Then warm—her body recognizing, accepting, cellular repair activating. Then nothing.

But something fundamental had shifted. She could feel it in her chest, the Hyper Seed responding to whatever Ryu had injected. Like giving water to a plant that had been dying slowly.

"So that's keeping me alive?"

"That's extending your cellular viability by approximately 18-24 months."

"You're very careful not to call it 'keeping me alive.'"

"Language precision is important in medical contexts."

"But I AM dying. Just... slower now."

Ryu paused. Weighed his words with the care of someone defusing a bomb.

"Your human cellular structure is degrading from temporal stress. The treatment counteracts this degradation."

"That's a very fancy way of saying 'yes, dying.'"

"Degradation and death are not always synonymous."

Ahdia caught it. Weird phrasing. "What does THAT mean?"

"It means the treatment is working as designed." He resumed packing his equipment, not meeting her eyes.

Before she could press, he continued:

"I need to make you aware of something. CADENS monitors temporal distortions globally. When you use your powers, we register the signature."

"You're tracking me?"

"We're tracking temporal anomalies. Yours happen to be... distinctive."

Every time she used her powers, CADENS knew. The realization settled into her chest next to the cold of the Seed.

"This is not surveillance," Ryu said. "This is protection. If WE can track temporal signatures—"

"Others can too."

"A flare we can triangulate to within ten meters. If someone else has that technology, they know where you are and when you're vulnerable."

The weight of it landed. She wasn't just dying faster when she used powers. She was advertising her location to anyone with the right equipment.

"This is why we come to you," Ryu said. "House call, not facility summons. Protection."

Ahdia understood: the house call was keeping her location private from CADENS staff. A small kindness. Or a leash disguised as kindness. She couldn't tell anymore.

"You're valuable, Ms. Bacchus. Act accordingly."

He resumed packing. Monitoring complete. But Ahdia's brain wouldn't stop turning.

"Ms. Bacchus, may I ask a personal question?"

"That's usually when doctors tell you you're dying faster."

"When did you last leave this apartment for non-essential purposes?"

Silence. She didn't have an answer. Or she had an answer and didn't want to say it.

"Isolation exacerbates depression," Ryu said quietly. "Depression exacerbates risk-assessment impairment."

"I'm not impaired. I did the investigation fine—"

"You burned 7% cellular integrity investigating a crime that had no immediate personal stakes."

Another hit. She'd used powers to feel useful, not because they were necessary.

"The treatment keeps your body functional. But your decision-making determines how long 'functional' lasts."

Depression was making her waste lifespan. The cage was becoming visible now—bars she hadn't noticed forming around her.

Freedom costs life. Using powers burns baseline.
Life costs freedom. Treatment keeps her dependent on CADENS.

She can't use powers without being tracked.
She can't survive without treatment.
She can't matter without burning the life she needs treatment to extend.

"Can I ask you something?"

"Of course."

"CADENS tracks translocation signatures, right? Like, who's authorized, when it's used?"

Ryu's hands stilled on his equipment. Just for a second. Then he resumed packing.

"That's classified operational data."

"I'm not asking for state secrets. Ben found a translocation signature at the sniper nest. He can't trace it without access logs."

"And you want me to...?"

"I don't know." She heard her own voice—flat, tired, the sound of someone who'd stopped pretending. "I just want to help. The team's investigating and I'm sitting here getting juice boxes and naps while they do the actual work."

"Treatment isn't optional. Without it—"

"I know. Eleven days. You told me."

The number hung in the air. Eleven days without treatment. That's how long she had before her cells gave up entirely.

"Geneva was trying to build something." Ahdia's voice had gone quiet. "And someone erased her mid-sentence. While I stood there."

"You couldn't have known—"

"I have powers that stop time and I couldn't save one person who actually mattered."

Ryu stopped packing. He stood there, medical case half-closed, looking at her with an expression she couldn't name. Concern. Guilt. Something else.

"The team's hitting walls," Ahdia said. "Ben needs translocation access. Tess needs to trace the bot network funding. And I'm just... here. On this couch. Watching news I can't hear about a woman I couldn't save."

"You're recovering. That's not nothing."

"It feels like nothing."

Long pause. Ryu's fingers drummed against the case—three taps, then stop. She'd noticed he did that when he was processing something difficult.

"I could look into a few things." His voice was careful. "Off the record."

Ahdia looked at him. "Really?"

"I'm not promising anything. But if there's information that could help the investigation... you're not wrong that CADENS would have it."

"That would be... yeah. That would help."

"I'll see what I can find."

He finished packing. Paused at the door.

"Get some rest, Ahdia."

The door clicked shut behind him.

Ahdia sat alone in her penthouse, treatment coursing through her veins, keeping her human for another few weeks. The cage was visible now—dependent on CADENS to survive, trackable whenever she used powers, isolated by depression, wasting the life she needed treatment to extend.

On the muted TV, a newscaster was saying something about a dictator in Eastern Europe. Some strongman vanishing without explanation. Unrelated. Background noise.

She didn't notice it yet.

But she would.

## Scene 3: The Kettle

Ruth had been standing at the kettle for three minutes. She knew because she'd been counting. Counting was better than thinking. Thinking led to places she couldn't afford to go.

The kitchen was dark except for the blue light of the gas burner. Everyone else had gone home or gone to bed. She'd told them she was fine. She'd told herself she was fine.

The kettle wasn't boiling. She'd forgotten to turn it on.

"Can't sleep either?"

Victor's voice, soft from the doorway. Ruth didn't startle—she'd heard him coming. Old habit from the ER. Always know who's behind you.

"Just thinking."

"About Geneva?"

"About all of it."

He moved into the kitchen. Got himself a glass of water. Leaned against the counter like he had nowhere else to be—which, at 2 AM in a penthouse that belonged to someone else, he probably didn't.

"You're holding a lot right now."

"Someone has to."

"That's not what I meant."

Ruth finally turned on the kettle. Watched the blue flame lick the bottom of the metal.

"Firas would've known what to do." The name slipped out before she could stop it. "He always—"

She stopped. The name hung in the air like smoke.

"Sorry. I don't know why I said that."

"Because you're grieving." Victor's voice was patient. Kind. "And you haven't stopped long enough to feel it."

"There's no time to—"

"Ruth."

She finally looked at him. His face was kind, which made it worse. She could handle cold. She couldn't handle kind.

"He told me, you know." Victor set down his water glass. "About a month before."

"Told you what?"

"That he was going to propose."

Ruth's breath caught. Her hands stopped moving.

"He had a whole plan. After the mission calmed down. He was going to take you to that place you went on your first date—the one with the terrible pasta but the view of the bridge."

"Marcello's." The word came out barely audible.

"He said you'd complain about the food the whole time and he'd pretend to be offended and then he'd ask."

Ruth set down the tea she'd been holding. Her hands were shaking. The kettle started to whistle.

"He never said anything."

"He was waiting for the right moment."

"And then there wasn't one."

"No."

The kettle screamed. Ruth turned off the burner. The silence after was worse.

"I was going to tell him I loved him." Her voice cracked on the last word. "I kept putting it off. Kept thinking there'd be time."

"He knew."

"How could he know if I never—"

"Because he knew you." Victor's voice was gentle but certain. "The way you looked at him. The way you always saved him the good coffee. The way you'd check his gear three times before missions."

Ruth was crying now. First time since Firas died. First time since the singularity took him. First time since she'd started holding everything together because someone had to.

"He knew, Ruth."

"I should've said it."

"Yeah. You should've." Victor didn't soften the words. "And he should've proposed sooner. And Geneva should've had security that knew what to look for. And none of that changes what's true."

"What's true?"

"That you loved him. That he loved you. That it mattered." He paused. "And that you're allowed to grieve AND lead. Both things. Not one or the other."

Ruth wiped her eyes. Couldn't find words.

"You don't have to be okay right now," Victor said. "You just have to keep going."

"That's what I'm trying to do."

"I know. Just... don't forget you're a person too. Not just the one holding everything together."

He squeezed her shoulder. Left her alone with her tea.

Ruth stood in the dark kitchen. Finally letting herself feel it. The grief. The loss. The proposal that would never happen. The words she'd never said.

Tomorrow she'd be the leader again. Tomorrow she'd hold everything together.

Tonight, she let it fall apart.
