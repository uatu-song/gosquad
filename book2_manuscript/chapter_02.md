# Chapter 2: The Assassination

## Scene 1: The Memorial

Three days since the riot. Three days since Daniel Okonkwo didn't go home.

Ahdia stood in the wings of the Caledonia Civic Center, watching two thousand people file into velvet seats for Daniel Okonkwo's memorial. The hall was one of those old buildings that tried very hard to look important—columns, gilded trim, a ceiling mural that probably meant something to someone who'd taken art history. She'd never taken art history. She'd taken computer science until she dropped out, and now she was standing backstage at a memorial for a man she couldn't save.

She did not belong there.

"Everyone in position?" Ruth's voice in her earpiece, calm and professional.

"North balcony clear." Ben. "Good sightlines on the crowd."

"Stage left," Ahdia said. "Feeling extremely useful. Definitely contributing."

"Blending in," Leah said from somewhere in the audience. "Also feeling extremely useful."

"Protesters are three blocks out," Victor reported. "Peaceful. Signs, candles, the usual."

"Eyes on audience," Tess added. "No obvious threats. Lots of pearls and blazers, though. Very threatening fashion choices."

This was what Go Squad did now, apparently. Contract work for shadow organizations. Standing around in new gear—CADENS-issued, not stolen this time, which meant tracking devices Ben hadn't found yet—waiting for something to go wrong.

Geneva Convention. That's what Bourn called it. The internal CADENS designation for events where Geneva Windrow and Harding Kain intersected. Every time they were in the same room, CADENS instruments went haywire. EM anomalies spiking off the charts. The riot had been the worst—readings so extreme they'd fried two monitoring stations—but it happened at campaign rallies too. Press conferences. Fundraisers. Anywhere the two of them breathed the same air.

Nobody knew why. That was the problem. CADENS had theories—Kain's campaign had access to something, Geneva was being targeted, cosmic interference, plain old equipment malfunction—but theories weren't answers. Answers required data. Data required sensors.

Ahdia was a sensor now. Her Seed reacted to whatever was causing those readings. That's why Bourn wanted her here. That's why Ruth had agreed to the deal. That's why she was standing backstage at a memorial for a man she couldn't save, waiting to feel something wrong in her chest.

The official cover was simpler: protect Geneva from harassment. She'd been vocal about police violence, about the riot, about the systems that let Daniel Okonkwo die. That made her a target—not for assassination, Ruth had said, but for intimidation. The kind of slow-burn threat that came from angry people who'd been told their anger was righteous.

So here they were. Watching for thrown tomatoes and angry protesters. And also watching for EM spikes that might mean something worse.

Ahdia hadn't told anyone about the other reason she'd volunteered.

Since the riot, something had been wrong. Not the baseline drop—that was quantifiable, manageable, a number Ryu tracked on his tablet. This was different. Pressure in her chest at random moments. Dreams she couldn't remember but woke from with her heart racing. The Seed felt... restless. Like it was waiting for something.

She needed to know if it was real or if forty-seven minutes of frozen time had finally broken something in her head that couldn't be fixed.

"Ahdia," Ruth said. "How's your chest?"

Not *how are you feeling*. Not *how's the baseline*. How's your chest. Because that's why she was really here.

"Pressure," Ahdia admitted. "Low-grade. Started about an hour ago."

Silence on comms. Everyone knew what that meant.

"Same as the riot?" Ruth asked.

"Lighter. But yeah. Same flavor."

She didn't mention the dreams. The restlessness. The sense that something was building toward a moment she couldn't see yet. That felt too much like crazy, and she was already pushing the limits of what the team would tolerate from their resident time-freezing liability.

"Stay sharp. If it spikes—"

"You'll be the first to know."

She didn't add: *that's assuming I know before whatever happens, happens.* At the riot, she'd felt the spike three seconds before everything went sideways. Three seconds wasn't much warning.

It was more than Geneva Windrow would get.

Ahdia scanned the hall. VIPs in the front rows, press in the back, plainclothes security doing their earpiece-and-sunglasses thing near the stage. Everything looked exactly like a political memorial was supposed to look—somber lighting, flowers on the stage, a blown-up photo of Daniel Okonkwo smiling in a way that made her chest hurt.

The pressure in her sternum pulsed. Just once. Like a heartbeat that didn't belong to her.

"Off like 'someone might throw a tomato,'" she said, "or off like 'assassination attempt'?"

Ruth didn't answer. Which was an answer.

---

The memorial started at 7 PM sharp.

Geneva Windrow took the podium first—tall, composed, the kind of presence that made you sit up straighter without knowing why. She wore a navy suit that probably cost more than Ahdia's monthly food budget, but she didn't wear it like armor. She wore it like work clothes. Like she had a job to do.

"Three days ago," Geneva said, "Caledonia witnessed tragedy."

The hall went quiet. Not the polite quiet of an audience waiting for applause lines. The heavy quiet of people who knew what was coming.

"A man named Daniel Okonkwo died in a protest turned violent. He was thirty-one years old. An accountant."

She looked down at her notes. Touched the edge of the paper. Didn't read from it.

"I have a speech prepared. My team worked very hard on it. Polling data, policy proposals, a really excellent pivot to my infrastructure plan." A small, tired smile. "They're going to be upset with me."

She stepped out from behind the podium. The stage lights followed her, harsh and unforgiving.

"I visited Daniel's mother yesterday. Gloria Okonkwo. She lives in a two-bedroom apartment in Eastwick with photographs covering every wall. I was supposed to stay fifteen minutes. Photo op, condolences, back to the motorcade. That's how these things work. You learn to schedule grief in increments."

Geneva stopped at the edge of the stage. Closer to the audience than any handler would have approved.

"I stayed three hours."

Someone in the crowd shifted. A cough. Otherwise, silence.

"Gloria showed me Daniel's room. He still lived with her—was saving up for a down payment on a condo, she said. Wanted to stay close. She showed me his desk where he did freelance accounting on weekends. Showed me his bookshelf. He liked science fiction. Asimov, Butler, Le Guin. His copies were worn soft at the spines."

Ahdia felt something in her chest that wasn't the Seed. Something older. More ordinary.

"And then she showed me his trains."

Geneva's voice caught. Just slightly. She didn't try to hide it.

"Daniel built model trains. Had a whole layout in his spare bedroom—mountains made of papier-mâché, tunnels he'd carved himself, a little town with a bakery and a church and a barbershop with a tiny striped pole. Twelve years he'd been working on it. Since college. His mother said he'd come home from work and spend hours in that room. Said it was the only time he really relaxed."

She stopped. Pressed her lips together. Took a breath.

"Gloria asked if I wanted to see it run. So I sat in her dead son's bedroom, in his desk chair that still had his jacket hanging on the back, and I watched his trains go around the track. The little town. The mountains. The tunnel he carved when he was twenty years old. Around and around."

The hall was absolutely still. Ahdia had stopped scanning for threats. Everyone had stopped everything.

"We sat there for twenty minutes. She held my hand. We didn't say anything. There was nothing to say."

Geneva looked up at the lights. Blinked. Looked back at the audience.

"My advisors told me not to talk about this. They said it's not strategic. They said voters want to see strength, confidence, solutions. They said—" She laughed, short and humorless. "They said 'don't cry on stage, it polls badly with independents.'"

A murmur in the crowd. Not disapproval. Recognition.

"Here's what I'm not supposed to tell you."

She moved back toward the podium but didn't stand behind it. Leaned against it instead, like she was tired. Like the performance had become too heavy to carry.

"I don't know what policy would have saved Daniel Okonkwo. I've been doing this for twenty-two years. I've written legislation, I've chaired committees, I've given more speeches than I can count. And I sat in that bedroom with Gloria and I didn't have a single answer for her. Not one."

Ahdia's throat was tight. She thought about the riot. The forty-seven minutes. The math that would never balance.

"Harding Kain is going to stand at this podium in a few minutes and tell you Daniel died because we don't have enough police. Because protesters are dangerous. Because order must be maintained." Geneva's voice hardened, but it wasn't politician-hard. It was the hardness of someone who'd seen something they couldn't unsee. "He's going to use that man's death—that quiet man who built model trains and read science fiction and lived with his mother because he loved her—as a talking point. A pivot. A line in a stump speech."

She shook her head.

"I've done it too. I've stood at podiums and said names of dead people and pivoted to policy. That's the job. You learn to metabolize tragedy into messaging. You learn to—"

She stopped. Something crossed her face. Decision.

"I'm so tired."

The words came out soft. Unguarded. Not meant for a microphone, but the microphone caught them anyway.

"I'm so tired of being strategic about dead people. I'm tired of calculating how much grief to show. I'm tired of—" She gestured vaguely. "This. All of it. The performance."

Ahdia felt frozen, and not in the way she could control. This wasn't a speech anymore. This was someone unraveling at a podium, on live television, in front of two thousand people and however many million watching at home.

Geneva straightened. Smoothed her jacket. When she spoke again, her voice was steadier, but the rawness was still there underneath.

"Daniel's girlfriend is still in the hospital. Maya. She has a broken collarbone and three fractured ribs from being trampled. She's twenty-nine years old. They were going to get engaged next month—Gloria showed me the ring. He'd been carrying it around for weeks, waiting for the right moment."

She looked directly into the camera. Not performing for it. Looking through it.

"Maya's going to wake up and Daniel won't be there. There's no policy for that. There's no legislation that fixes that. There's no five-point plan that brings him back to finish his trains or give her that ring or—"

Her voice broke. She let it.

"I don't have answers tonight. I know that's not what you want to hear. I know you came here for a debate, for zingers and soundbites, for someone to tell you they've got it all figured out."

She wiped her eye with the back of her hand. Didn't try to hide it.

"I don't have it figured out. What I have is Gloria Okonkwo's phone number in my pocket because I promised I'd call her tomorrow. What I have is a lot of doubt and not enough sleep and the memory of watching a dead man's trains go around a track while his mother held my hand."

Geneva looked at the photograph of Daniel behind her. Then back at the audience.

"But I have something else too."

Her voice changed. Not harder—deeper. Like she was reaching for something she didn't usually say out loud.

"I have a vision. And I'm going to share it with you tonight, even though my team is going to kill me, even though it's not polling-tested or focus-grouped, even though it sounds—" She paused. "Even though it sounds impossible."

She stepped forward again. Away from the podium entirely now. Standing at the very edge of the stage, close enough that people in the front row could have touched her.

"I see a world."

The words hung there. Simple. Strange.

"I see a world where Gloria Okonkwo doesn't have to choose between paying rent and paying for her diabetes medication. Where Daniel didn't have to work weekends doing freelance accounting just to save for a down payment on a modest home. Where Maya doesn't wake up to medical bills that will bankrupt her before she's finished grieving."

Geneva's eyes were distant now. Focused on something the audience couldn't see.

"I see a world where everyone has enough. Not the same—we're not the same, we don't want the same things—but *enough*. Enough food. Enough shelter. Enough medicine. Enough security to build model trains in your spare bedroom without wondering if you'll lose everything to one bad month."

Ahdia felt something stir in her chest. Not the Seed. Not grief. Something like... hunger. Like hearing someone describe a meal when you'd forgotten you were starving.

"Some people call that socialism. Some people call it naive. Some people call it—" Geneva smiled, a little sadly. "—unrealistic. But I've sat with Gloria Okonkwo, and I've sat with families in Appalachia and the South Side and rural Oregon, and I'm telling you: they're not asking for the moon. They're asking for *enough*."

She began to pace. Slow. Thoughtful. Like she was working something out in real-time.

"But enough isn't enough. I know that. Because I've also sat with artists who feel like their work doesn't matter. With entrepreneurs who feel suffocated by bureaucracy. With young people who want to build something new and keep being told to wait their turn."

Her voice lifted. Found a new register.

"I see a world where we have enough AND we have freedom. Where the baseline is security, but the ceiling is infinite. Where you're not one medical bill away from ruin, so you can actually take risks. Start that business. Make that art. Say what you actually think without worrying about losing your health insurance."

Ahdia noticed the security detail shifting near the exits. Restless. Like they felt it too—that something was off.

"The lie they tell us," Geneva said, "is that we have to choose. Security or freedom. Equality or excellence. Taking care of each other or letting people fly. But that's a lie told by people who benefit from us fighting over scraps."

She stopped pacing. Faced the audience directly.

"Daniel Okonkwo built model trains. He also did freelance accounting on weekends and read science fiction and went to protests and lived with his mother. He contained multitudes. We all do. And a society that forces us to choose—that makes us pick one part of ourselves and abandon the rest—that's not a society. That's a prison with better marketing."

A ripple through the crowd. Shifting. Leaning forward.

"I see a world where the artist and the engineer sit at the same table. Where the risk-taker and the caretaker aren't enemies. Where we stop pretending that my freedom to swing my fist has to end at your nose—where we build a world with enough *room* that we don't have to constantly negotiate whose dreams matter more."

Her voice was building now. Finding something approaching fervor, but grounded. Real.

"I see a world where we take care of the vulnerable. Not because they're useful. Not because they might become productive. Because they're *people*. Because a society is measured by how it treats those who can't fight back. The disabled. The elderly. The children. The sick. The different. The difficult."

She paused. Her eyes found someone in the audience—a woman in a wheelchair near the aisle.

"I see you," Geneva said, directly to her. "And in the world I'm describing, you wouldn't have to fight so hard just to exist."

The woman's hand went to her mouth. Her companion's arm around her shoulders.

"But here's the part that keeps me up at night."

Geneva's voice dropped. Quieter now. More intimate, despite the microphones, despite the cameras, despite the two thousand people hanging on every word.

"It's not enough to have enough. It's not enough to be free. It's not enough to be taken care of. We need something else. Something harder to name."

She touched her chest. Right over her heart.

"We need it to *mean* something."

The hall was so quiet Ahdia could hear the electrical hum of the stage lights.

"I've met people who have everything. Money, security, freedom, health. And they're *empty*. I've met people who have nothing—nothing material, nothing secure—and they're the most alive humans I've ever encountered. Because they have *purpose*. They have *struggle*. They have something to push against."

She shook her head slowly.

"This is the part that scares me. Because I want to end suffering. I want to end poverty and disease and violence and all the thousand ways we break each other. But I also know—I *know*—that some part of us needs the struggle. Needs the challenge. Needs the possibility of failure to make success mean anything."

Ahdia's breath caught. This wasn't a campaign speech anymore. This was something else. Something that felt almost dangerous.

"How do you build a world where no one *has* to suffer, but everyone still has the chance to *strive*? Where we've solved the problems that destroy people, but we haven't solved away the problems that *make* people? Where we've ended the meaningless pain but kept the meaningful challenges?"

Geneva laughed softly. At herself, it seemed.

"I don't know. I really don't. Maybe it's impossible. Maybe we're built for scarcity and we'd fall apart in abundance. Maybe we need our brokenness more than we know."

She looked up. Something fierce in her eyes now.

"But I refuse to accept that. I refuse to believe that the only way humanity works is if most of us are suffering. I refuse to tell Gloria Okonkwo that her son had to die for some cosmic balance to be maintained. That's not a society. That's a sacrifice machine, and we're all just fuel."

Her voice rose. Found its full power.

"I believe—I have to believe—that we can build something better. Something that keeps the struggle without requiring the suffering. Something that gives everyone enough without making anyone empty. Something that—"

She stopped. Smiled. A real smile, the first one of the night.

"Something that lets a quiet man build model trains in his spare bedroom, and take risks when he's ready, and be taken care of when he falls, and find meaning in all of it. Without needing to die at thirty-one to remind us that life matters."

The applause started. Not the polite debate applause. Something rawer. Wetter. People crying and clapping at the same time. People who had forgotten they were at a political event and remembered they were humans watching another human say true things out loud.

Geneva raised her hand. The applause faded. She had one more thing to say.

"I know this sounds like a dream. I know my opponent is going to call me a utopian. And maybe he's right. Maybe the world I'm describing can't exist. Maybe Thomas More was right and *utopia* really does mean *nowhere*—the place that can't be."

She stepped back toward the podium. Put her hands on its edges. Leaned forward like she was telling a secret to two thousand people.

"But I'd rather spend my life reaching for nowhere than accept that this—" She gestured. At the hall. At everything. At the whole broken world. "—that this is the best we can do. I'd rather fail trying to build something beautiful than succeed at maintaining something ugly."

She straightened. Found her formal voice again, but it was different now. Softer. Like the performance was finally aligned with the person.

"Daniel Okonkwo went to that protest because he believed showing up mattered. He believed that bodies in the street could change things. That visibility was power."

Her voice cracked slightly. She let it.

"He was right. It does matter. It can change things. That's why people like Harding Kain work so hard to make it dangerous."

She looked out at the audience. Two thousand faces. Some crying. Some stone-faced. Some leaning forward like they'd never heard a politician speak before. Like they'd forgotten politicians *could* speak like this.

"I can't bring Daniel back. I can't promise you I'll build the world I just described. I can't even promise I'll win this election." A ghost of a smile. "My advisors are definitely firing me after this."

A ripple of laughter. Wet, uncomfortable, relieved.

"What I can promise is this: if you give me the chance, I will never stop reaching for that world. I will never accept that suffering is necessary. I will never—"

The pressure in Ahdia's chest spiked.

Her HUD flickered—EM readings spiking hard, same pattern as the riot, stronger now, much stronger. The hum behind her sternum was almost painful. She opened her mouth to say something, to warn—

"—I will never forget that Daniel Okonkwo built model trains, and read science fiction, and loved his mother, and went to a protest because he believed—he *believed*—"

The window behind the stage made a sound like a single note struck on crystal. A small, clean hole appeared in the glass—perfectly circular, edges fused smooth.

Geneva stopped mid-word.

Her mouth was still open. Her hand was still extended toward the audience—reaching, like she could touch them, like she could close the distance between podium and people, between politician and human being, between the broken world and the beautiful one she'd been describing.

*—he believed—*

The lights went out in her eyes.

Not metaphorically. Ahdia watched it happen. One moment Geneva Windrow was *there*—present, alive, burning with conviction—and then she just... wasn't. The animating force behind her face switched off like someone had pulled a plug. Her expression didn't change. Her body didn't jerk. She simply stopped being a person and became a thing that hadn't fallen yet.

Two seconds. Maybe three. Geneva stood there, hand still reaching, mouth still open around a word she would never finish. A thin line of blood traced down her temple—almost delicate, almost nothing. The entry wound was barely visible. A dark point, no bigger than a pencil eraser.

Then gravity remembered her.

She dropped. Not dramatically, not cinematically. Just... dropped. Like a marionette with cut strings. Her body hit the podium, knocked it sideways, knocked her notes into the air—pages scattering, white rectangles floating down like leaves while her body hit the floor with a sound that was somehow worse than any gunshot.

The thud of weight. The thud of something that used to be a person and now was just mass and cooling cells.

The hall didn't scream. Not yet.

For three seconds—maybe four—maybe a lifetime—two thousand people sat in their velvet seats and didn't breathe. The silence was physical, a pressure, a vacuum where sound should be. Where the rest of her sentence should be. Where the beautiful world she'd been describing should be.

Ahdia could hear the buzz of the stage lights. The creak of someone's chair. The soft flutter of Geneva's notes settling on the floor. The distant hum of the HVAC system, doing its job, circulating air through a room where air no longer seemed to exist.

Blood pooled beneath Geneva's head. Slow. Patient. Taking its time. Spreading across the polished wood in a dark halo. Like it didn't know the urgency was over. Like it didn't know she was gone.

Her hand was still extended. Still reaching. For the audience. For the world she'd described. For nowhere.

*I'd rather spend my life reaching for nowhere than accept that this is the best we can do.*

That was the promise. That was what she'd been building toward. And now she was a body on a stage, and her nowhere was exactly as far away as it had always been, and her notes were soaking red at the edges, and her hand was still reaching.

The woman in the wheelchair in the front row was staring. Mouth open. Hand still at her face where she'd touched it when Geneva had seen her. Had said *I see you*.

No one saw her now. Everyone was looking at the body.

Daniel Okonkwo. Gloria. The model trains. The ring Maya would never receive. The world where everyone had enough and everyone was free and everyone found meaning without suffering.

All of it. Gone. Mid-sentence. Mid-thought. Mid-reach.

Then someone in the front row started screaming, and the silence shattered, and two thousand people remembered how to move and breathe and panic, and the beautiful nowhere Geneva Windrow had been reaching for collapsed into chaos, into terror, into the ugly world she'd refused to accept.

---

"SNIPER!" Ben's voice cracked through comms. "Northwest vector, high angle!"

The hall erupted. People surging toward exits, trampling each other, the panic spreading like fire through dry grass. Ahdia was still staring at the stage. At the body. At the blood pooling on the polished wood where Geneva Windrow had been standing three seconds ago, describing a world worth living in.

"EVERYONE DOWN!" Ruth shouted.

Secret Service swarmed Kain—surrounding him, moving him toward the secure exit. Not Geneva. Geneva was beyond help. Geneva was a body now, a crime scene, a thing that used to be a person.

Ahdia had seen death before. She'd held her brother while he died. She'd watched Daniel Okonkwo die at the riot while she froze time and couldn't save everyone.

But she'd never watched the light leave someone's eyes. She'd never seen that exact moment—the switch from person to thing, from alive to gone—happen in real-time, mid-sentence, mid-reach.

*—he believed—*

That was the last thing Geneva Windrow ever said. Not a complete thought. Not even a complete sentence. Just a fragment, hanging in the air forever.

"Ahdia!" Ruth's voice. "AHDIA!"

She blinked. The hall was chaos. People crushing toward exits, falling, screaming. The choreography had shattered into something primal and terrified.

"I'm here," she said. Her voice sounded strange. Distant. "I'm here."

"We need crowd control. Can you hold?"

Could she hold? She'd burned twenty-three points of baseline three days ago. Ryu said she needed treatment. Her chest still ached from the riot, and now there was this EM pressure, this hum that wouldn't stop, stronger than before.

On the floor near the east exit, a woman went down. People kept moving, stepping on her, stepping over her.

"I can hold," Ahdia said. "Not long. But I can hold."

She reached for the cold.

---

## Scene 2: Forty Seconds

The world went purple.

Darker than before. The color of a bruise, not the pale lavender she was used to. Her HUD flickered once, twice, then stabilized with a warning she didn't read.

Silence.

Two thousand people frozen mid-scream. Mid-run. Mid-fall.

Ahdia moved.

Not thinking. Couldn't think. The freeze was already slipping—she could feel it, like trying to hold water in cupped hands. Draining. Faster than it should.

Woman on the floor near the east exit. Two men about to step on her. Ahdia grabbed her under the arms, dragged her sideways, propped her against the wall. Safe. One.

Back into the crowd. Frozen faces everywhere. Mouths open. Eyes wide. A snapshot of terror she had to walk through.

Teenager pinned against a pillar. Crowd crushing in. Ahdia shoved at frozen bodies—they moved, slowly, like pushing through setting concrete. Made a gap. Pulled the kid free. Propped him in the gap. Two.

Her nose was bleeding.

She wiped it. Kept moving.

Elderly man on the ground near the center aisle. People frozen mid-step above him. One wrong angle and his ribs would crack when time resumed. She grabbed his arm, pulled him clear, felt something in her own chest *twist*—

The edges of her vision went black.

No. Not yet. One more. She could get one more.

She saw her. A woman in a wheelchair near the front row—the one Geneva had seen, had said *I see you* to—and she was tipped sideways, about to fall, about to be trampled by the crowd surging away from the stage.

Ahdia ran.

Ten feet away. Five.

The freeze broke.

Not released. *Broke*. Like a wire snapping. Like her body saying *no more* without asking permission.

Sound crashed back in. Screaming. Running. The chaos that had been frozen mid-surge now surging again, and Ahdia was on her knees somehow, palms flat on cold marble, blood dripping from her nose onto the floor.

She hadn't reached her.

Three. She'd saved three people.

The woman in the wheelchair—someone caught her. Ahdia saw it through the forest of running legs. A man in a gray suit, grabbing the chair, steadying it. Stranger. Random act of decency in the middle of horror.

Not Ahdia. She was on the floor. She couldn't even stand.

"Ahdia!" Ruth's voice in her ear. "Ahdia, report!"

"I'm—" The word came out wrong. Wet. She tried again. "Down. I'm down. East side. Near the pillar."

"Stay there. Ben's hunting the sniper. Victor's coming to you."

She didn't have a choice about staying. Her legs weren't working right. Her vision was still black at the edges, and the purple hadn't faded—everything still looked bruised, like the world itself was injured.

*CELLULAR INTEGRITY: 59%*

Dropped eight points. In forty seconds.

The math was getting worse.

Around her, the crowd was thinning. People making it to exits. Security finally doing their jobs, directing traffic, shouting orders. The initial crush was over. The panic was becoming organized evacuation.

On the stage, Geneva Windrow's body lay in a spreading pool of blood. Her hand still reaching. Her notes scattered and soaking red.

Ahdia couldn't look away.

*I'd rather spend my life reaching for nowhere than accept that this is the best we can do.*

She'd believed it. Ahdia had watched her say it and *believed* it, for just a second, that someone in power might actually mean the things they said.

And now Geneva was dead, and the nowhere she'd been reaching for was exactly as far away as ever.

"Ahdia." Victor's voice. Real voice, not comms. He was crouching beside her, hand on her shoulder. "Can you walk?"

"I don't know."

"Let's find out." He got an arm under her, lifted. Her legs wobbled but held. Barely. "There you go. Lean on me."

He half-carried her toward the side exit. Away from the stage. Away from the body. Away from the woman in the wheelchair who Ahdia hadn't been fast enough to save.

*Three*, she thought. *I saved three people.*

It didn't feel like enough. It never felt like enough.

---

They made it outside. Emergency vehicles everywhere—police, ambulances, news vans already setting up for the shot. The night air was cold and Ahdia breathed it in, trying to clear the bruise-purple from her vision.

Ruth met them by the side entrance. Her face was controlled, professional, but her eyes were doing that thing they did when she was holding too much in.

"Ben lost the sniper," she said. "Rooftop was empty by the time he got there. Professional job—they were gone before the first scream."

"How?" Victor asked.

"He's checking. But that shot..." Ruth shook her head. "800 meters, moving target, through glass. That's not amateur hour. That's military or better."

Ahdia leaned against the wall. Her legs were shaking. "She's dead."

"Yes."

"She was talking about—about a world where everyone has enough. About Daniel's trains. About—" Her voice cracked. She didn't know why. She hadn't known Geneva Windrow. Had only stood in the wings and watched her speak. But something about the way she'd died—mid-sentence, mid-reach, mid-hope—

"I know," Ruth said. Softer now. "I heard it too."

"I only saved three people."

"Three people who would have died without you."

"There were more. The woman in the wheelchair—"

"Someone else got her. I saw."

"It should have been me."

Ruth didn't argue. Didn't tell her she'd done enough, or that she couldn't save everyone, or any of the other things people said when they wanted you to feel better about failing.

Instead, she just said: "Your nose is still bleeding."

Ahdia touched her face. Her fingers came away red.

"Ryu needs to see you. Tonight. Not tomorrow."

"I know."

Leah and Tess appeared from around the corner. Tess was pale. Leah was shaking—not from cold.

"We were ten rows away," Leah said. Her voice was strange. Flat. "We saw the whole thing. Her head just—she was talking and then she wasn't and there was—"

"Don't," Ruth said. "Not here. Not yet."

"I want to hit something."

"I know. Later."

Tess hadn't said anything. She was staring at her phone, scrolling, her face doing something complicated.

"What?" Ruth asked.

"Kain's about to give a statement. Live. CNN."

They gathered around the phone. Ahdia didn't want to watch, but she couldn't look away.

Harding Kain stood at a podium somewhere—his campaign headquarters, probably. American flags behind him. The lighting was perfect. He looked *ready*, like he'd been waiting for this moment.

"Tonight," he said, "Caledonia lost a leader. Governor Geneva Windrow was a public servant who dedicated her life to this city. We disagreed on many things—but I respected her commitment to her beliefs."

His voice was smooth. Practiced. Every word calibrated.

"This act of domestic terrorism will not stand. The radical elements who perpetrated this violence—who turned a memorial for Daniel Okonkwo into a scene of bloodshed—will be found and brought to justice."

Ahdia's chest tightened. *Radical elements.* He was already framing it. Already spinning it.

"Geneva wanted to protect Caledonia's vulnerable. She can't anymore." Kain paused. Let it land. "I will. I promise you—I will make this city safe. I will restore order. I will ensure that no family has to lose a mother, a daughter, a leader, to senseless violence."

"He's campaigning," Tess said quietly. "On her corpse. He's literally—"

"Yes," Ruth said.

"It's been twenty minutes. She's not even cold yet and he's—"

"Yes."

On the screen, Kain was still talking. Something about strength. Something about security. Something about the path forward.

Ahdia stopped listening.

She was thinking about Geneva's hand. Still reaching. Still extended toward an audience that had run away screaming. Reaching for a world that didn't exist yet. That might never exist.

*I'd rather spend my life reaching for nowhere.*

Kain was reaching too. But not for nowhere.

For everything.

And right now, with Geneva's blood still wet on the floor of the Caledonia Civic Center, he was winning.

## Scene 3: Fragments

Ben came back.

Ahdia saw his face before she heard his voice. Something bad. She knew that look—the one where someone had information they didn't want to have.

"Nest was on the Meridian Building." He was talking to Ruth. "Eighteenth floor. Maintenance access."

Ruth asked something. Ahdia didn't catch it. Her ears were ringing, or maybe that was just what happened when you burned eight points of baseline in forty seconds.

"—dust on the floor. Perfect circle where the shooter stood. No footprints out. No exit trail."

Dust circle. That meant something. Ahdia tried to hold onto it. The wall was cold against her back. When had she started leaning on the wall?

"My ears were still ringing when I got there," Ben said. "Pressure differential. Ozone. I've felt it before—joint ops with translocation assets."

Ruth's face did something. Went still. That was bad. Ruth going still was always bad.

More words. Ahdia caught pieces. *Professional. Military grade. Clean extraction.* The pieces didn't fit together in her head. They floated past like debris in water.

Her legs were shaking. Had been shaking. She should sit down. She should—

The wall slid up. Or she slid down. One of those.

"I got you." Victor. His arm under hers, catching her weight. "There's a bench. Come on."

She let him move her. The bench was cold. Everything was cold. The ambulance lights made red and blue patterns on the building across the street and she watched them pulse because it was easier than listening.

The team kept talking. Ben's voice, Ruth's voice, someone else. Tess saying something about her phone, about the news, about how fast it was spreading.

Ahdia looked up.

Rooftop of the parking structure. Across the street.

Someone standing there.

She blinked. Blinked again. Her vision was blurry, purple-edged, unreliable.

The figure didn't move. Hood up. Watching.

Watching her.

Purple light flickered. Around the figure's hands. Just for a second. The same purple. The exact same purple as the bruised world she'd walked through forty seconds ago.

Ahdia opened her mouth.

The figure turned. Stepped back from the edge. Gone.

"Ahdia." Victor's voice. Close. "Hey. You with us?"

She stared at the empty rooftop. At the space where someone had been.

"I..." She shook her head. "Nothing. I'm just—"

"Gray," Ruth said. She was crouching in front of Ahdia now. When had that happened? "You're gray and your pulse is thready and Ryu's meeting us at the penthouse. Car. Now."

Ahdia didn't argue. Didn't have the energy. Victor and Ben got her up, got her moving. Leah and Tess flanking, watching the street like something else might come out of the dark.

She looked back once. At the parking structure.

Empty.

The car was warm. Ruth drove. Ahdia closed her eyes and let the city blur past the windows and didn't think about the figure on the rooftop. Didn't think about purple lightning. Didn't think about Geneva's hand still reaching on a stage somewhere behind them.

She didn't think about anything.

That was easier.

---

## Scene 4: Treatment

Ryu was already at the penthouse when they arrived.

Pacing. That specific Ryu pacing—tight circles, hands clasped behind his back, glasses doing their usual slightly-crooked thing. He turned when the elevator opened and his face cycled through about four expressions in two seconds: relief, worry, more worry, then that clinical mask he put on when he was trying not to feel too much. Like watching someone flip through TV channels looking for the right one.

"Ruth called ahead," he said. "I've got the treatment ready. You should sit."

Ahdia didn't argue. Her legs made the decision for her anyway—three steps into the living room and they just quit, union rules, and she dropped onto the couch hard enough to knock a pillow to the floor.

Okay. Okay okay okay.

Ryu was already moving. Medical kit on the coffee table, the sleek CADENS autoinjector laid out next to gauze and monitoring patches. His fingers drummed on the kit's edge—tap tap tap-tap, tap tap tap-tap—that rhythm he fell into when his brain was chewing on too many variables at once. She'd seen him do it during the riot. During Firas. During every moment when the math got too ugly to say out loud.

"Fifty-nine percent," he said, not looking at her. "You were at sixty-seven this morning. That's eight points in—" He checked his tablet. "Forty seconds. The degradation curve is accelerating, which means the cellular repair protocols need to account for—" He stopped. Took a breath. "Sorry. You don't need the math right now."

"I really don't."

Ruth was still in the doorway. "I'll check in with the others. Give you two some space."

Gone before Ahdia could protest. Not that she would have. The apartment felt too big with people in it and too empty without them, and right now she couldn't figure out which one was worse. Schrödinger's loneliness. Both states at once until someone opened the box.

Ryu sat on the coffee table across from her. Close, but not touching. He had the autoinjector in his hand, turning it over, studying it like he'd never seen one before. Which he had. Many times. On her arm specifically.

"Last time," he said quietly. "The sound. It triggered something."

She didn't answer. Didn't have to.

"I'm going to count down from three. So you know when it's coming." He met her eyes—actually met them, not the sideways glances he usually defaulted to when faces got too complicated. "Is that... would that help?"

He'd noticed. Of course he'd noticed. He got the upload. Forty-seven minutes of watching her bleed from her eyes and wave her hand through his chest like he wasn't there. He noticed everything.

"Yeah," she said. "That would help."

He nodded. Positioned the injector against her arm. His hand was steady even though she could see the tension in his shoulders, the rigid line that said *I'm holding it together because someone has to*.

"Three."

She closed her eyes.

"Two."

Geneva's hand, still reaching. The small dark hole in her temple.

"One."

*Click. Hiss.*

The sound landed somewhere deep, echoed with red light and blue light and Firas's lips moving—but Ryu's voice had been there first. The countdown gave her something to hold. A rope in the dark.

When she opened her eyes, Ryu was watching her. Not clinically. Just watching. The way you watch someone you're worried about when you don't know what to say.

"Okay?" he asked.

"Okay."

He set the injector aside. Started applying the monitoring patches—wrist, temple, base of her throat. His movements were precise, practiced, but gentler than they needed to be. Like she might break. Like she hadn't already.

"You can talk about it," he said. "Or not. I'm not—I don't need you to process out loud. But if you want to, I'm..." He gestured vaguely at himself, at the room, at the whole situation. "Here. Obviously. Physically present in this location."

Her mouth did something that wasn't quite a smile.

"She was talking about a world." The words came out before she'd decided to say them. "Geneva. Right before. She was describing this place where everyone has enough. Where people don't have to suffer just to make life mean something."

Ryu's hands paused on the last patch.

"She called it nowhere. Like the word utopia—means 'no place.' A place that can't exist." The ceiling was the same ceiling she'd stared at a thousand times during 3 AM insomnia spirals, but it looked different now. Farther away. Unreachable. "She said she'd rather spend her life reaching for nowhere than accept that this is the best we can do."

"That's..." Ryu was quiet. His fingers had stopped drumming entirely, which was rare. Almost unheard of. "That's a significant philosophical position."

"It was a beautiful speech. And then someone shot her in the head."

The words just sat there. Brutal. True. No softening them. No TV-appropriate euphemism. Someone shot her in the head and she died mid-sentence with her hand still reaching for an audience that was already running away.

Ryu didn't try to comfort her. Didn't say *I'm sorry* or *that must be hard* or any of the things people said when they didn't know what else to say but felt like they should say something. He just sat there. Close but not touching. Letting the silence be what it was.

"Her hand was still reaching," Ahdia said. "After. When she fell. She was reaching for the audience. For the world she was describing. And then she was just—" Her voice cracked. She hadn't expected that. "Gone. And her hand was still reaching for nowhere."

Ryu was completely still now. No drumming, no fidgeting, no adjusting his glasses. Just still.

"I watched a lot of TV," he said. "When I was younger. Before CADENS. It was easier than—" He waved a hand. "People. Faces. The TV didn't expect me to make eye contact."

She didn't know where he was going with this. But his voice was soft, and he was trying, and that counted for something.

"There was this show. Old one, before my time, but I found it online. Star Trek. The original series." A small, self-conscious shrug. "The future they described—no poverty, no war, everyone working together to explore the unknown. I knew it wasn't real. I knew it was just... television. But I used to think about it. What it would feel like to live in a world like that."

He looked at her. That same direct eye contact, the kind that cost him something.

"Geneva was describing that world. The one I used to watch on a screen and pretend was possible." His voice barely audible now. "And someone killed her for it."

Her eyes burned. Not the Seed. Not cellular degradation. Just the ordinary human kind that meant she was about to cry, which she hadn't done in—how long? Since Firas. Since the reversal. Since the last time someone sat with her and didn't try to fix anything.

"Yeah," she whispered. "Yeah, they did."

They sat there. Two people in a penthouse that was too big for one person and too small for grief. The city glittered outside the windows, doing its city thing, going about its night like nothing had happened. Like Geneva Windrow hadn't died reaching for a better world. Like the math balanced somewhere Ahdia couldn't see.

Ryu didn't touch her. Didn't try to fix anything.

Just stayed.

*That was enough,* she thought. And then: *Is it? Is that enough?*

She didn't have an answer. She let the question sit there, unresolved, the way questions did when you were too tired to chase them down.

---

## Scene 5: The Night After

### Ahdia

Ryu left around midnight. She'd told him she was fine, that she'd sleep, that she didn't need him to stay. All lies, but comfortable ones. The kind of lies you tell people so they don't have to watch you fall apart.

The penthouse was too quiet after he was gone. The city hummed outside the windows—traffic, distant sirens, the white noise of a million people living their lives like Geneva Windrow hadn't died mid-sentence eight hours ago.

Ahdia stood at the window. The couch was right there. The bed was in the other room. Both of them were perfectly good places to lie down and close her eyes and pretend that sleep was something she could just *decide* to do.

Instead she watched the city lights and thought about nowhere.

*I'd rather spend my life reaching for nowhere than accept that this is the best we can do.*

Geneva's hand. Still reaching. The small dark hole in her temple. The way the light had gone out of her eyes—not slowly, not peacefully, just *off*, like someone had flipped a switch.

Ahdia rubbed her eyes. They burned. Everything burned. Her chest, her head, the space behind her sternum where the Seed lived.

*You should sleep. Ryu said sleep. Ruth said sleep. Everyone says sleep like it's something you can just decide to do, like you can flip a switch and—*

Her eyes drifted to the rooftop across the plaza.

Not that rooftop. A different one. The building with the green water tower.

Figure standing at the edge.

Hood up. Face shadowed.

Purple light flickering around their hands.

*That's not—*

The figure turned. Looked directly at her. Not at the penthouse. Not at the window. At *her*. Like it could see through the glass, through the walls, through whatever distance should have made this impossible.

Ahdia's heart slammed against her ribs.

*It sees me. It knows exactly where I am.*

She blinked.

Gone.

The rooftop was empty. Green water tower. Night sky. No figure. No purple lightning. Just the city, going about its business, like nothing had happened.

"What the hell are you?" she whispered.

The window didn't answer. The city didn't answer. The pressure in her chest pulsed once, twice, and then went quiet.

Third time. That was the third time she'd seen it. Riot. Parking structure. Now.

*Three times means something*, her brain supplied unhelpfully. *Three times means you're either losing your mind or being stalked by something that glows purple. Neither option is great.*

She didn't sleep that night. She sat on her couch, in her spot, and watched the rooftops until the sun came up.

Nothing else appeared.

That didn't make her feel better.

---

### Tess

Tess's apartment looked like a conspiracy theorist's fever dream, which was either appropriate or deeply ironic given the circumstances.

Three monitors. Energy drink cans forming a small fortress around her keyboard—Red Bull, Monster, something Korean that Korede had recommended and tasted like liquid regret. Timestamp spreadsheets covered every available surface.

"Okay, you little bot bastards," she muttered, fingers flying. "Where'd you come from?"

The bot network was sophisticated. Not the usual Russian troll farm garbage—this was domestic, well-funded, and *fast*. Thousands of accounts pushing the same talking points within minutes of each other. "Domestic terrorism." "Radical elements." "Law and order." Kain's phrases, amplified across every platform simultaneously.

She'd been at this for hours. Since the team scattered. Since Geneva Windrow's hand stopped reaching.

The sound of a key in the lock made her flinch. The door opened.

"...Tess?"

Leta stood in the doorway, bag over her shoulder, taking in the scene—girlfriend at computer, energy drink graveyard, the particular chaos of someone who hadn't moved in hours.

"You're *home*."

The way she said it. Like finding water in a desert.

"Hey! Yeah, I'm—" Tess spun her chair around, trying for casual. "Work thing got canceled. Last minute."

Leta dropped her bag by the door, moving toward her. The kind of smile that made secrets feel heavier.

"I can't remember the last time you were here when I got home. This is—"

She stopped. Looking at the monitors. The energy drink civilization.

"Baby, have you slept?"

"Sleep is for people who aren't fueled by spite and artificial taurine."

Tess stood, moving to intercept before Leta got a good look at the screens. "How was the meeting?"

Leta let herself be redirected. Tired. Leaning into Tess slightly, and god, she smelled like coffee and cold air and the specific exhaustion of people who cared too much about a world that kept breaking.

"Heavy. Everyone's processing Geneva. Korede's a mess—he was at the riot, you know? And now this." She shook her head. "He keeps saying he should've done more. Should've helped more people get out."

*Korede ran toward tear gas like an idiot and almost got himself killed. Ahdia dragged him out. He's alive because of us. He'll never know that.*

"That's... yeah. That's a lot." Tess kept her voice level. "Is he okay?"

"Physically? Fine. But he's been beating himself up since the riot. Survivor's guilt, I think."

Leta moved toward the bedroom, then stopped. Turned back.

"The community's organizing a vigil. Tomorrow night. Geneva deserves—" She paused. "You should come. I know you're not usually... but it would mean a lot."

*Tomorrow night I might be on a rooftop watching for threats at whatever event Ruth calls. Tomorrow night I might be tracing these bots to whoever killed Geneva. Tomorrow night I might be anywhere except where my girlfriend needs me to be.*

"I'll try," Tess said. Soft. Honest, for once. "I really will."

Leta searched her face. Deciding to believe it.

"Come to bed? It's late."

"I just need to finish something. Work stuff. Ten minutes."

The sigh of someone who'd heard "ten minutes" before. "Ten minutes."

She moved to the bedroom. Paused at the door.

"I'm glad you're home, Tess."

"Me too."

*Liar. Liar liar liar.*

The door closed. Tess turned back to the screens.

Right. Bot bastards.

She traced them back. VPNs, proxy servers, shell accounts—someone had spent real money on obfuscation.

But money couldn't hide everything.

The activation timestamps. That was the key. When did these accounts start pushing the narrative?

She pulled the data. Sorted by time.

First wave: 6:47 PM. "Radical elements gathering." "Potential violence." "Law and order at risk."

She checked her notes. Geneva was shot at 7:23 PM.

The bots were pushing fear narratives about the memorial *before* anyone died. Priming the audience. Setting the frame.

Then, at 7:24 PM—one minute after the shot—the pivot. Thousands of accounts, simultaneously: "Domestic terrorism." "Geneva died because of radical elements." "This is what happens when we don't support law and order."

One minute.

"What the hell..."

She stared at the screen. The numbers didn't change no matter how long she looked.

One minute to pivot thousands of accounts to a coordinated message about a death that just happened. That wasn't reactive. That was *infrastructure*. A machine built to exploit any crisis, sitting ready, waiting for something to weaponize.

"Someone built this," she whispered. "Someone's been building this for a long time."

The assassination and the narrative machine weren't necessarily the same operation. But someone had spent serious money making sure that when violence happened—any violence—Kain's message would be first and loudest.

She glanced toward the bedroom door. Leta asleep by now. Normal girlfriend. Normal life. Warm bed waiting for her.

She turned back to the monitors.

She kept digging.

---

### Kain

The private office was dark except for a single lamp. Harding Kain had dismissed his staff an hour ago—told them he needed time to process, to grieve, to prepare for the days ahead. They'd believed him. They always believed him.

He wasn't grieving.

He was pacing. Twelve steps to the window, twelve steps back to the desk. The city lights spread out below like scattered embers, and somewhere out there Geneva Windrow's body was being photographed, catalogued, reduced to evidence.

His phone buzzed. Private line. The one only three people had the number for.

He answered.

"Report."

The voice came from everywhere and nowhere—not through the phone's speaker exactly, but *around* it. Like reality had folded slightly to let the sound through. Kain had stopped questioning the mechanics months ago. Some questions were better left unasked.

"Geneva Windrow is dead."

Silence. The kind of silence that had weight to it.

"I am aware." No grief in the voice. No surprise. Nothing human at all. "The Temporalist's position during the speech."

Kain stopped pacing. That wasn't the response he'd expected. Geneva was dead—the woman who'd been polling twelve points ahead, the obstacle they'd spent six months maneuvering around—and all she wanted to know about was the girl with the purple lightning?

"We had eyes on the balcony. The one with the Hyper Seed. She was there when the shot was fired."

"And she did nothing."

"Nothing. Stood in the wings. Watched her die."

The silence stretched longer this time. Long enough that Kain checked his phone to make sure the connection hadn't dropped.

"This is what you wanted," he said carefully. "Geneva was your obstacle. Now she's—"

"You misunderstand." The temperature in the room seemed to drop. "Geneva was never an obstacle."

"Then why did we spend six months positioning for—"

"The Temporalist was supposed to save her."

Kain's pacing stopped entirely. "What?"

"Every iteration. Every cycle." The voice was flat, reciting facts. "The shooter fires. The Temporalist intervenes. Geneva survives. The pattern holds."

"You *wanted* Geneva to survive?"

"The assassination attempt is a constant. It happens every time—different shooter, different weapon, same result. The Temporalist preventing it is supposed to be a constant as well. The shooter's identity is irrelevant. I do not know it. I do not care. What matters is that my piece performs its function."

"Your piece."

"The girl. Ahdia. She exists to protect Geneva. That is why the Hyper Seed bonded with her. That is why she has those powers." A pause. Something almost like emotion bleeding through the flatness. "She is my hands in a dimension I cannot reach."

Kain moved to the window. His reflection stared back at him—composed, controlled, the face he showed the cameras. But underneath, something cold was spreading through his chest.

"And she just... didn't?"

"No."

"Why?"

The silence this time was different. Heavier. Like the voice on the other end was holding something back—or holding something *in*.

"That is what you will determine."

"Me?"

"You have assets. Use them. I need to know why the Temporalist deviated from the pattern. Where she was positioned. What she was doing. What she *chose* not to do."

Kain turned from the window. "If she didn't save Geneva, maybe she's not under anyone's control. Maybe she made her own choice."

"She is a tool I created." Flat. Final. "Tools do not make choices."

"This one did."

The silence stretched. Somewhere in it, Kain thought he heard something—a breath, maybe. Or the ghost of one.

"What happens now?" he asked. "Without Geneva—"

"You have an election to win. Your opponent is dead." The voice had recovered its cold precision. "I expect you will find that... convenient."

"And the Temporalist?"

"Continue monitoring. I will handle the deviation."

"Handle it how?"

"That is not your concern."

Kain pushed. He shouldn't—he knew he shouldn't—but the question was there and it wouldn't stay down. "She has the Hyper Seed. She can freeze time. If she's gone off-script, she's dangerous. To both of us."

"The Seed was my insurance policy for four iterations. If the policy has... lapsed, I will need to find an alternative."

"An alternative Temporalist?"

"An alternative solution." Something shifted in the voice. Not warmer—colder, if anything. The cold of deep space. "The shooter will return. They always do. Without Geneva to protect, without the pattern to maintain..."

"What?"

"The game has changed." The finality in those words could have frozen oceans. "Report when you have information on the Temporalist's actions."

"And if I can't get that information?"

"Then you are less useful than I believed."

The connection ended. Not a click—more like the sound had simply stopped existing, leaving Kain alone in his dark office with the city lights and the weight of what he'd just learned.

Four iterations. The voice had said *four iterations*. Like this had all happened before. Like Geneva's death was supposed to be prevented, every time, by a girl who could stop time.

And this time, the girl had chosen not to.

Kain looked out at the city. Somewhere out there, Ahdia Bacchus was probably staring at a ceiling, or a window, or the inside of her own head. Probably had no idea that her inaction had broken something much larger than one politician's life.

Or maybe she did know. Maybe that was the point.

He reached for his phone. Started making calls.

The game had changed. Time to learn the new rules.

---

## Scene 6: Nowhere

She existed between dimensions now. Had for years—since Montana, since the avatar's destruction, since she'd been torn from the third dimension and locked out permanently. The space she inhabited wasn't physical. It was something else. A fold in reality where a being like her could persist without a body.

It was cold. Not temperature-cold—concept-cold. The absence of warmth as a fundamental property of existence.

The upload was still happening.

Geneva's consciousness bleeding in. Not data. Not memory in the clinical sense. *Experience*. The full weight of a life flowing back to its source.

*Stop*, she thought. *This is residue. This is—*

Geneva's last moment hit her like a wave.

Hand reaching. Mouth open. The word "believed" half-formed on lips that would never finish it. The audience a blur of faces—some crying, some stone-faced, all of them *listening*, actually listening, and she'd felt it, Geneva had felt it, the moment when a room full of strangers becomes something else, something unified, something that might actually—

Bellatrix forced the experience down. Compartmentalized. She'd done this before. Three times before. She knew how to wall off the uploads, how to file them away where they couldn't touch her.

But they always touched her.

*You were supposed to live.*

The thought came unbidden. Not her thought—or was it? After four uploads, after four Genevas absorbed into her consciousness, she couldn't always tell anymore whose grief was whose.

*Four times. Four times I built you. Four times I watched you become... this.*

Another wave. Geneva in Gloria Okonkwo's living room. The model trains going around the track. The old woman's hand in hers—papery and warm and trembling. And Geneva had felt it, actually *felt* it, the weight of a mother's loss, and it hadn't been performance, it hadn't been calculated—

*That wasn't the script. You weren't supposed to feel it. You were supposed to use it.*

But Geneva always felt it. That was the flaw in the design—or the feature, depending on how you looked at it. Consciousness copies diverged. They became their own people. They developed the capacity to genuinely care about the things they were supposed to only strategically care about.

Naima's template, reshaped by experience, became something Naima never was: a true believer.

*I know.*

She did know. She'd watched it happen four times. Four Genevas, each one starting from the same template, each one becoming someone who actually believed in the world they were trying to build. Someone who reached for nowhere like it was a real place. Like it could be touched.

The final upload hit.

Geneva's last second. Not fear—confusion. *Why am I falling? Why is the light—*

And then nothing. The abrupt termination of a consciousness that had been mid-thought, mid-reach, mid-hope.

Bellatrix absorbed it. Added it to the others. Another layer of scar tissue on her cosmic form.

*The Temporalist was there.*

The thought crystallized, cold and sharp.

*She was right there. I felt her. The Seed was active. She could have—*

The realization settled in slowly. Like frost forming on glass.

*She chose not to.*

Bellatrix existed in the space between dimensions and felt something she hadn't felt in 3.7 billion years of cosmic existence: genuine surprise.

Her own creation. Her own hands in the third dimension. The tool she'd engineered specifically to solve this unsolvable problem—the one variable she'd thought she controlled—

Had made a choice.

*You were not supposed to have choices. You were supposed to be a function. A variable I controlled.*

But consciousness copies diverged. She knew that. She'd built the Genevas knowing that. Had she thought Ahdia would be different? That the Seed would keep her aligned? That twenty years of human neurodevelopment wouldn't reshape a cosmic consciousness into something that could say *no*?

Geneva's voice, still echoing in the upload: *I'd rather spend my life reaching for nowhere than accept that this is the best we can do.*

*You reached for nowhere and you almost made me believe it.*

The thought surprised her. She tried to wall it off, but it slipped through—

*Again. Four times you've made me believe it. Four times I've watched you reach and fall and—*

She stopped.

The cold of between-dimensions pressed in. The absence of warmth. The absence of anything except her own consciousness and the four dead Genevas she carried inside it.

*And I keep doing this.*

The thought was quiet. Dangerous.

*I keep building you. I keep watching you become someone who hopes. And then I watch you die with your hand still reaching.*

The grief wasn't hers. It was Geneva's grief, uploaded and absorbed. It was Naima's grief, from before—from Montana, from the children, from the life she'd lost when she tried to end it. It was four lifetimes of accumulated loss layered over a cosmic consciousness that had eliminated emotions 3.7 billion years ago.

And she couldn't separate them anymore.

*This was supposed to fix it. The perfect version. The one who succeeds. The one who proves that—*

That what? What had she been trying to prove?

*That I wasn't wrong. That the infection can become strength. That love can build instead of break.*

Geneva's upload completed. Her consciousness fully absorbed. Another incomplete life. Another interrupted arc. Another hand reaching for nowhere that would never get there.

Bellatrix existed in the cold between dimensions and did not move.

Then, slowly, the stoicism returned. The armor she'd built over 3.7 billion years of existence. The control that had allowed her to watch worlds die without flinching.

*The Temporalist will be dealt with.*

The thought was cold. Precise. The voice she used with Kain.

*The shooter will return. They always return. And I will find another way.*

She always found another way. That was what she did. That was what she was. A being of infinite patience and infinite determination, engineering solutions across cosmic timescales.

*I always find another way.*

But underneath the cold, something Geneva had left behind:

A hand. Still reaching.

For nowhere. For something that couldn't exist. For a world where everyone had enough and everyone was free and a quiet man could build model trains in his spare bedroom without dying at thirty-one.

Bellatrix felt it. The reach. The hope.

She couldn't stop feeling it.

*He believed—*

She cut the thought off. Walled it away. Added it to the others.

The space between dimensions was cold. The absence of warmth as a fundamental property.

She existed there alone, carrying four deaths, four hopes, four reaches toward nowhere that never got there.

And somewhere, in a dimension she couldn't touch, a girl who was supposed to be her hands had decided to stop reaching.

The pattern was broken.

Bellatrix would have to build a new one.

She always did.
