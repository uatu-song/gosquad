# Chapter 1: The Riot

## Scene 1: Downtown Caledonia - Peaceful Protest (Evening)

### Beat 1
**Rolls:** Environment (12), Ahdia State (14)

The sky on Feed 3 couldn't decide if it was evening or just giving up. Gray on gray, the kind of overcast that swallowed the sunset without announcing it.

Ahdia shifted in her chair, pulling her hoodie tighter around herself. The penthouse was cold—she kept it that way, easier to stay awake—and the glow from her wall of screens didn't help. Four drone feeds tiled across the main display: north approach, south approach, main plaza, crowd density overlay. Two thousand people, maybe more. Signs bobbing like a sea of cardboard: *Justice for Isaiah. Say His Name. Black Lives Matter.*

She flicked through the team's HUD feeds with a gesture.

Night Knight on the northwest rooftop, prone behind his scope. His feed showed the crowd from above, crosshairs drifting methodically across sections like he was reading a book. Old habits.

Gloom Girl and Battlea at street level, east side. Tess had her hood up, slouched against a wall like she was waiting for a bus. Leah beside her, arms crossed, trying too hard to look casual.

Nightingale was on the south rooftop, elevated position with full sightlines. Her feed showed the whole plaza laid out below—crowd, police line, side streets. The view of someone who needed to see everything to call the plays.

Crimson Sable's feed was the only one without a HUD overlay. Victor had insisted on civilian gear tonight—no suit, no mask, just a discreet earpiece. His camera angle came from his phone, half-pocketed, showing a cluster of young organizers he was talking to. Teaching them something, from the way they were nodding.

No one was breaking anything. No one was even shouting that loud.

"This is weird, right?" she said into comms. "We're just... watching people not commit crimes?"

### Beat 2

Nightingale's voice came through steady. "Protective presence, Auerbach. We're here if they need us."

"Unlike the fifty cops in riot gear who showed up to 'protect' them last time," Battlea muttered.

### Beat 4

She watched the feeds cycle through. Candles. Linked arms. A woman at the microphone talking about her son.

It looked like every protest montage she'd ever seen on cable news—the peaceful kind they always showed in retrospect, after something went wrong. *See how calm it was before?* Organized. Emotional. Zero molotov cocktails.

She waited for the other shoe to drop.

### Beat 5

"Clean so far." Night Knight's voice, clipped and professional. On his feed, the crosshairs panned across the crowd in slow sweeps. "Families, elderly folks. Not seeing agitators."

### Beats 6-8

"Sable, you good down there?" Night Knight asked, scope still sweeping.

"All quiet." Victor's voice was low, casual—blending in. "These kids know what they're doing. Better organized than half the nonprofits I've worked with."

"How are those boots holding up, Battlea?" Nightingale asked.

Battlea's sigh was audible. "I'm pretty sure CADENS sized these for someone with hooves."

"Mag-lock soles take adjustment. Give it another week."

"Easy for you to say. You got the medical sensors. I got clown shoes."

Gloom Girl's snort came through clear. "You literally asked for wall-climbing boots."

"I asked for *functional* wall-climbing boots. There's a difference."

### Beats 9-10

On the main plaza feed, someone started a call-and-response. *What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now.* The rhythm spread through the crowd like a wave. Fists raised. Candles flickering. A little girl on her father's shoulders, holding a sign she probably couldn't read yet.

This wasn't a riot waiting to happen. It was a community deciding to be seen.

Ahdia leaned back in her chair. Pulled her knees up. Watched.

First mission where nothing bad happens, she thought. Weird. But nice.

### Beat 11

6:47 PM.

"Nightingale, north perimeter." Night Knight's voice had changed. Flatter. "You seeing this?"

A pause. Then Ruth: "I see it."

Ahdia flicked to Feed 2. The police line on the north side—riot gear, batons, the whole theater of force. They'd been standing there for an hour. She didn't know what she was supposed to be seeing.

"What am I looking at?" she asked.

"Their hands," Nightingale said. "Watch their hands."

Ahdia watched. One cop adjusted his grip on his baton. Another shifted his weight forward. A third leaned toward the officer next to him, said something.

"The crowd hasn't changed," Night Knight said quietly. "They have."

### Beat 12

Ahdia glanced at the vitals overlay in the corner of her screen. Heart rates across the board were creeping up. Leah at 94—she was a derby jammer, usually sat in the low 60s. Tess at 89. Even Ben, prone and still behind his scope, was at 82.

"You guys all pre-game with espresso or something?" She meant it as a joke. "Ben, you're supposed to be the calm one."

"Maybe focus on the feeds, Auerbach." Night Knight's voice came back clipped. Not mean. Just... tight.

Ahdia blinked. Ben didn't snap. Ben was the steady one.

No one else said anything.

### Beat 13

She pulled back from the screens.

*Focus on the feeds.* Like she wasn't. Like she was just sitting here making jokes while they were out there actually doing something.

Firas would have been out there with them. Not watching from a bank of monitors in a cold penthouse, making dumb quips about espresso. He'd have been on a rooftop, or in the crowd with Victor, or—

She was the reason he wasn't. The reason he couldn't be.

The thought settled in her chest like it belonged there. *You're not a teammate. You're a replacement. A bad one.*

She shoved it down. Focused on the feeds.

### Beat 14

From somewhere in the murk of her own head, she almost missed it.

A man shoving someone on Feed 4. A woman yanking her kid back by the arm on Feed 1. Two teenagers squaring up where a banner used to be.

A minute ago these people were singing. What did she miss? Had she zoned out again?

"I'm seeing it too." Nightingale's voice, sharp now. "Something's moving through the crowd. Not physical—behavioral. It's spreading."

"From where?" Victor, low and urgent.

"I don't know. But we're not waiting to find out."

### Beats 15-17

"Nightingale, call it." Ben, done waiting.

"Battlea—north side, now. That police line's about to do something stupid."

Leah didn't need to be told twice. On her feed, Ahdia saw her plant her back foot, saw her mouth open—

The battle cry came through comms half a second before Ahdia felt the cold hit her chest.

She was already there. The Seed flaring, frost spreading through her ribs, and on Leah's feed the world went syrup-slow around her—just her, just that sliver of space—while FAERIS locked on and *pushed*.

Leah *moved*. Street level to the north barricade in the time it took a cop to blink. Sixty feet in maybe two seconds, if you were being generous with the math.

The cops didn't see her coming. That was the point.

Ahdia's fingers trembled on the console. The cold in her chest didn't fade—it settled. Made itself at home.

### Beat 18

"Knight—high ground, west side. I need overwatch on the crowd, not just the cops."

Ben was already in his crouch. That coiled, athletic stance that said *I'm about to do something physics doesn't approve of*.

She didn't wait for him to jump. Reached for the Seed before his feet left the rooftop—felt it answer, felt the cold sink deeper into her bones this time, settling in like it planned to stay.

On his feed, the air around Ben went thick and strange. FAERIS did the rest.

He launched off the northwest rooftop like gravity had personally offended him, arcing forty feet across the gap to the western tower. Landed in a roll, scope up before his knees touched concrete.

"Overwatch established." Cool as ever. Like he hadn't just jumped a canyon.

Ahdia flexed her fingers. They were slower to respond than they should have been.

### Beat 19

"Gloom Girl—rooftop across from Knight. I need a second angle on that police line."

Tess locked her gaze on the rooftop Ruth called. Then winked. Left eye.

The FAERIS drone pulsed once—reading her iris, calculating depth—and Tess was just *gone*. Reappeared on the rooftop half a second later, stumbling slightly on the landing.

"In position." A little breathless, but grinning. You could hear it in her voice.

"Still getting used to the new gesture," Ahdia said. "I miss the finger."

"Of course you do."

"Flipping the bird was a real statement. Now you're just coming on to the world."

"Very funny." Tess's voice had an edge. "Saying screw you is more your thing than mine, Auerbach."

### Beat 20

Silence on the line. Ahdia could see Tess's heart rate tick up another few points on the overlay.

"Auerbach, I didn't mean—" Tess started.

A sharp chirp cut her off. On Tess's feed, Ahdia watched her pull a handheld device from her utility belt—bulky, home-modded, covered in electrical tape and solder points.

"Hold on," Tess said. "I'm getting weird EM interference. The whole plaza."

Before Ahdia could ask, Battlea's voice cut through.

"Feed 4, northwest corner. Behind the dumpster."

Ahdia switched feeds. A figure in black bloc gear, face covered, crouched low. Hands busy with something.

"He's got a bottle," Battlea said.

"It's a protest," Ahdia said. "People bring water."

"He's stuffing a rag in it," Night Knight said.

"People bring... rags?"

"Lighter," Tess said.

"People bring—" The flame caught. "Shit."

"*Move,*" Nightingale said.

### Beat 21

The bottle arced high over the crowd—trailing fire, trailing screams—and shattered against the police line.

Glass and flame. Someone's shield. The cop stumbled back, and for half a second nobody moved.

Then the line charged.

### Beat 22

"They're not dispersing," Ben said. "They're *attacking*."

On Feed 2, riot shields slammed into the front row of protesters. Batons swinging. No warning, no bullhorn, no *this is an unlawful assembly*. Just violence, immediate and coordinated.

"That response time," Tess said. "They were waiting for an excuse."

"They didn't need one," Victor said, voice tight. "They just wanted one."

### Beat 23

Ahdia's fingers flew across the console, cycling feeds. Northwest—two more black bloc figures, moving through the chaos with that same wrong-footed grace. Not running *from* the violence. Moving *through* it. Like they knew where the gaps would be.

"I've got two more," she said. "Same gear, same movement pattern. They're not panicking."

"Because they're not protesters." Ben's crosshairs tracked one of them. "Professional agitators. I've seen this before."

"Great," Leah muttered. "So we're fighting cops *and* fake protesters. Anyone else want to join? Maybe some clowns?"

"Don't jinx it," Tess said.

### Beat 24

"Sable, get out of there." Ruth's voice cut through. "You're civilian cover, not combat."

"I've got people down," Victor said. On his feed, an elderly woman on the ground, a teenager trying to shield her. "I'm not leaving them."

"Victor—"

"Thirty seconds. I've done more with less."

"That's not the flex you think it is," Leah said.

### Beat 25

On Victor's feed, Ahdia watched him haul the woman up, pass her to the teenager, point them toward an alley. The kid nodded, pulled the woman with him, disappeared into the gap between buildings.

A cop broke from the line, baton raised. Victor saw him coming—shifted his weight, let the swing pass, caught the arm and redirected. Krav Maga. Economy of motion. The cop stumbled past and Victor was already moving, putting distance between himself and the line.

A second cop. Victor ducked the first swing, blocked the second, drove an elbow into the man's ribs. But a third was flanking—he didn't see the baton until it caught him across the shoulder. He rolled with it, came up in a crouch, but a fourth cop was already there. Boot to the chest. He went down hard, phone skittering across concrete. The feed spun—sky, pavement, boots.

"Sable's down!" Leah's voice.

The feed went dark.

### Beat 26

"Sable!" Ruth's voice, sharp. "Status!"

Nothing. The feed stayed dark.

Ahdia's hands were already moving, pulling up Victor's last known position, his vitals—heart rate 112, elevated but steady. He was alive. He was down. He wasn't responding.

"I've got his position," she said. "Northwest corner, behind the community center. He's mobile but his comms are out."

"Mobile how?" Ben asked. "Walking mobile or crawling mobile?"

"Does it matter?"

"It matters for extraction."

### Beat 27

On Feed 1, the police line hit the crowd.

Not pushing—*hitting*. Batons swinging at heads, at arms raised in surrender, at people already falling. Tear gas blooming in thick white clouds. The screaming was everywhere now, coming through every feed, layered and raw.

"They're not trying to disperse them," Ben said, scope tracking. "They're trying to hurt them."

"Ben." Ruth's voice was tight. "I need solutions, not commentary."

"Working on it."

### Beat 28

Two more black bloc figures on Feed 3. Same coordinated movement, same wrong grace. One threw something—not a bottle this time. Bigger. Heavier.

The canister hit the ground and erupted in a wall of smoke so thick it swallowed the plaza's center whole.

"Military-grade," Ben said. "Someone's funding this."

"What, you think protestors are getting care packages from Lockheed Martin?" Tess's voice crackled through comms.

"I think someone wants this to look like a riot," Ben said. "And they brought receipts."

### Beat 29

The stampede started in earnest.

Two thousand people, maybe more, all trying to move at once. Ahdia watched the feeds fracture—bodies colliding, falling, trampling. An elderly man went down on Feed 2. A woman lost her grip on a child's hand on Feed 4.

The math was happening whether she wanted it to or not. How many would die in a crush this size? How many were already hurt? How many could she save if she—

The cold pulsed in her chest. Waiting.

### Beat 30

"Nightingale," she said, and her voice came out steadier than she felt. "I can stop this."

A pause. Ruth knew what that meant. They all did now.

"Ahdia—"

"I know what it costs." She was already standing, already reaching for the Seed. "FAERIS, paint me for translocation. Center of the plaza."

The drone acknowledged. The cold spread through her ribs.

"Forty-seven seconds," she said. "That's all I need."

She didn't know if that was true. She said it anyway.

### Beat 31

The FAERIS drone locked on. She felt it—that strange pull behind her sternum, the world getting ready to fold.

"Ahdia, wait." Ruth's voice. "We don't know how bad—"

"I'm looking at the feeds, Ruth. I know exactly how bad."

### Beat 32

Feed 2: A child, maybe six, separated from her father. Frozen mid-scream, about to be trampled.

Feed 4: An elderly man on his knees, hands over his head, a cop's baton raised above him.

Feed 1: A pregnant woman pinned against a barricade, crowd crushing in.

"I see at least twelve critical," Ahdia said. "That's just what's on camera."

### Beat 33

"If you burn out in the middle of that crowd—" Ruth started.

"Then I burn out saving people instead of watching them die from a penthouse." She pulled the HUD headset tighter. "I've done the math. I don't like it either."

### Beat 34

"Battlea, Knight—cover her arrival point. Gloom Girl, extract Sable the second she freezes."

Ruth was already pivoting. Already planning around Ahdia's choice instead of fighting it.

"Copy," Ben said.

"On it," Leah said.

Tess didn't answer. She was already winking, already gone.

### Beat 35

The translocation hit like a cold wave breaking over her skull.

One second: penthouse, screens, the safe distance of watching.

Next second: plaza center, smoke and screaming, the crowd a living thing pressing in from all sides.

### Beat 36

The smell hit first. Tear gas, sweat, blood, fear—fear had a smell, sharp and animal. Then the sound: not screaming anymore, just a roar, thousands of voices compressed into white noise.

She couldn't see the feeds anymore. She was *in* the feed now.

### Beat 37

A man slammed into her shoulder, didn't even look, kept running. Someone else's elbow caught her ribs. The crowd wasn't a collection of people—it was a current, and she was drowning in it.

*Focus.*

The cold in her chest. The Seed. The only thing that could stop this.

### Beat 38

She saw the child from Feed 2. Real now, not pixels. A little girl in a yellow dress, fallen, curled into a ball as feet churned around her.

Three seconds until someone stepped on her. Maybe less.

### Beat 39

Ahdia reached for the cold. Let it spread. Felt it climb through her ribs, her spine, her skull.

*Forty-seven seconds,* she'd said.

The world began to slow.

### Beat 40

Time stopped.

The roar cut off like someone had hit mute. The bodies around her froze mid-stride, mid-fall, mid-scream. Tear gas hung in the air like fog that forgot how to move. A baton suspended six inches from a protester's skull.

Ahdia stood alone in the silence.

She had work to do.

---

## Scene 2: Frozen Time - Crowd Control

The little girl in the yellow dress was still falling.

Ahdia walked toward her, each step crunching on gravel that didn't move. The girl's face was frozen in that specific terror kids get when they know an adult can't save them—mouth open, eyes squeezed shut, waiting for impact.

"Okay," Ahdia said to no one. "You first."

She crouched, slid her arms under the girl's suspended body, and lifted. Lighter than she expected. The girl didn't weigh anything in frozen time, or maybe Ahdia's sense of weight was as broken as everything else right now. She carried her ten feet to the left, away from the stampede's path, set her down in a crouch that would resolve into a stumble instead of a fall.

One.

The cold in her chest pulsed. Not painful yet. Just present.

She turned back to the crowd. Two thousand people, frozen mid-panic. Tear gas hanging in white curtains. A cop's baton six inches from a skull. A woman's hand reaching for a child she'd already lost.

"This is fine," she muttered. "This is totally the Quicksilver scene from X-Men, except I'm bleeding and probably dying. Cool. Cool cool cool."

Her HUD flickered in the corner of her vision. *TEMPORAL SUSPENSION ACTIVE. CELLULAR INTEGRITY: 89%.*

She started walking.

---

The elderly man on his knees took thirty seconds. She repositioned him behind a concrete planter, out of the crush zone. The woman reaching for her child took another twenty—she reunited them, posed the mother's arms around the boy's shoulders so when time resumed they'd be holding each other.

Three. Four.

A teenager frozen mid-fall, phone still clutched in his hand, about to hit concrete face-first. She caught him, turned him, set him down in a controlled sprawl that would bruise instead of break.

Five.

*CELLULAR INTEGRITY: 86%.*

Blood dripped from her nose. She watched it fall in real-time—the only thing moving besides her—and hit the frozen ground without a splash.

She kept working.

---

Minute eight.

A cop was about to bring his baton down on a protester's skull. The protester—a man in his sixties, gray beard, "Justice for Isaiah" sign fallen at his feet—had his arms raised in surrender. The cop's face was twisted into something that didn't look like fear or anger. It looked like nothing. Just a job being done.

Ahdia stood between them, studying the angle.

If she moved the protester, the baton would hit air. The cop would stumble, maybe fall. The protester would live.

But that felt like choosing sides.

Ruth's voice in her memory: *Protect civilians. All of them.*

She adjusted the protester's position—two feet to the left, arms still raised, so the baton would catch his shoulder instead of his skull. Painful. Not fatal. Then she tilted the cop's trajectory, just slightly, so the follow-through would put him off-balance.

Neither of them would know what happened. They'd both walk away.

Both/and.

*CELLULAR INTEGRITY: 81%.*

Six. Seven.

---

Minute fifteen.

A brick hung in the air, trailing fragments of mortar like a comet's tail. Its trajectory would end at a cop's face—young guy, couldn't be more than twenty-five, frozen mid-flinch because he'd seen it coming and couldn't move fast enough.

Ahdia reached up and nudged the brick. Just a few degrees. It would hit the ground now instead of his cheekbone.

She didn't know if he was a good cop or a bad one. She didn't know if he'd been in the line that charged without warning, or if he'd been trying to de-escalate. She didn't know anything about him except that he was twenty-five and about to lose an eye.

"You're welcome," she said. "Or not. I don't know. Just—don't be an asshole when you wake up."

Eight.

*CELLULAR INTEGRITY: 74%.*

The nosebleed was worse now. She could taste copper in the back of her throat.

---

Minute twenty-three.

Her legs were starting to shake.

The HUD had stopped giving her percentages. It just flashed red now: *CRITICAL. CRITICAL. CRITICAL.*

She'd saved fifteen people. Repositioned another eight who were about to be trampled. Redirected four projectiles—two bricks, a bottle, something that might have been a rock or might have been a phone, she couldn't tell and didn't care.

Twenty-three.

The crowd still stretched in every direction. Frozen faces. Frozen screams. Frozen violence.

She couldn't save them all. She'd known that going in. But knowing it and *feeling* it were different things.

"Ryu would tell me to stop," she said. Her voice sounded strange. Wet. "Ruth would tell me to stop. Everyone would tell me to stop."

She kept walking.

---

Minute thirty-one.

She was in the northwest corner now. The smoke was thickest here, tear gas frozen into a solid wall of white that she had to push through like curtains. Her eyes burned even though the gas wasn't moving. Some things didn't care about physics.

AR-Ryu flickered into existence beside her, his lab coat too clean for a riot, his expression calibrated to "concerned but professional." He wasn't really there. He was never really there. Just her HUD projecting what it thought she needed.

"Cellular integrity at forty percent," he said, falling into step with her. "Ahdia, you need to stop."

"Everyone keeps saying that."

"Because it's true. You're approaching irreversible damage thresholds."

She waved her hand through his chest and kept walking. He flickered, reset, followed.

"Recommend immediate suspension cessation."

"Yeah," she said. "I heard you the first time."

A figure ahead. Black hoodie, jeans, sneakers—not a protester in the traditional sense, no sign, no linked arms. Just a kid who'd gotten caught in the wrong place.

She got closer.

Korede.

Leta's little brother. Seventeen, maybe eighteen. She'd seen him in the feeds earlier, filming the speeches, looking proud of his sister. Now he was frozen mid-sprint, heading directly into a tear gas canister that would detonate six inches from his face the moment time resumed.

"Oh, you absolute *idiot*," she breathed. "Why are you running *toward* the gas?"

She grabbed him. Her arms felt like they were made of wet paper. The cold in her chest had spread to her spine, her skull, the backs of her eyes.

*CELLULAR INTEGRITY: 31%.*

She dragged him backward. Ten feet. Fifteen. Far enough that the canister would miss him, the gas would disperse before reaching him, he'd be scared but not blinded.

Twenty-four.

But he was the one who mattered. He was the one she'd recognized.

"Leta would kill me if I let you die," she said to his frozen face. "And then Tess would kill me again, somehow. And Ruth would figure out a way to kill me a third time. So you're welcome."

She let go. Her hands were shaking so badly she could barely feel them.

*CELLULAR INTEGRITY: 28%.*

---

Minute forty-seven.

She couldn't stand anymore.

The world was blurring at the edges—not the frozen world, that was still sharp, still terrible in its clarity. Her vision. Her eyes were failing. Blood ran freely from her nose, her ears, and when she touched her face her fingers came away red from her tear ducts too.

She was crying blood. That seemed bad. That seemed like the kind of thing a person should be concerned about.

AR-Ryu was still there, flickering at the edge of her vision. His mouth moved but the words came delayed, broken: "Cellular integrity... critical... immediate cessation..."

"Shut up," she whispered. "I know. I *know*."

Twenty-four people. She'd saved twenty-four people who would have died in the next thirty seconds of real time. Protesters and cops and kids and old men and a woman who'd been reaching for her son.

It wasn't enough. It was never going to be enough.

But it was what she had.

She let go.

---

The world exploded back into motion.

Sound hit her first—the roar of the crowd, the screaming, the tear gas canisters popping, all of it slamming into her ears like a physical force. Then the movement, bodies surging around her, the chaos she'd been walking through suddenly alive and violent and *loud*.

She tried to take a step. Her legs buckled.

The ground came up fast. She had time to think *this is going to hurt* before her cheek hit concrete and everything went sideways.

"AHDIA DOWN!" Ruth's voice, somewhere far away. "Northwest corner! Someone get to—"

The rest of it faded into static.

The last thing she saw, before the darkness took her, was a little girl in a yellow dress. Running. Alive.

Worth it, she thought.

And then nothing.

---

## Scene 3: Aftermath — CADENS Medical

The ceiling was wrong.

Too white. Too still. No smoke, no frozen faces, no purple tint. Just acoustic tiles and recessed lighting and that specific beeping rhythm that said *you're alive but we're monitoring the situation*.

Her mouth tasted like copper and something chemical.

"...Ruth?"

"Hey. You're at CADENS." Ruth's fingers were on her wrist—taking her pulse, not holding her hand. Doctor first. "Pupil response is good. Can you tell me what day it is?"

"The day I watched a riot from my penthouse and then decided to teleport into it like an idiot?"

"Close enough." Ruth's mouth twitched. "You've been out about four hours. How's your vision? Any blurring at the edges?"

Four hours. CADENS. Medical. Okay. Okay okay okay.

The riot. The freeze. The little girl in yellow. Korede running toward tear gas like he was trying out for a Darwin Award—

"The crowd." She tried to sit up. Her arms didn't cooperate. "How many—"

Ruth's hand pressed her shoulder back down. Firm. Not negotiable.

"Don't move yet. Your cellular integrity dropped significantly—we're still running numbers." A pause. "Ryu's working on it."

Ryu was at a console across the room. His fingers were drumming on the edge of the keyboard—that rhythmic pattern he did when he was deep in data, processing something he didn't like. He hadn't turned around.

"Ryu?"

The drumming stopped. Started again. "Your baseline dropped to sixty-seven percent. That's—sorry, let me just—" He pulled up another screen, scrolled through something. "Twenty-three points in under an hour, which is, I mean, the cellular degradation curve is—" He caught himself, shook his head. "Sorry. Ruth's calculating revised treatment intervals. The short version is: not great."

That wasn't what she'd asked. She'd asked *Ryu?*—which, okay, wasn't technically a question, but the subtext was pretty clear.

Movement in the doorway. Director Bourn stepped into the room, tablet in hand, already reading something on the screen.

"Ms. Bacchus. Good to see you conscious." She didn't look up from the tablet. "We're going to need a full debrief on the agitators you observed. Their movement patterns suggest professional coordination—I'd like your assessment when you're stable."

Not *calculating asset value*. Just... bureaucratic. Efficient. The voice of someone who managed cosmic threats like quarterly reports.

"Looking forward to it," Ahdia said, not meaning it even a little.

Ruth still hadn't answered the question. How many.

"Ruth. How many didn't make it?"

Ruth's hand found hers now—the pulse-check shifting into something warmer. "One. A man near the south barricade. Trampled before you reached that section."

One.

One person died while she was freezing time for forty-seven minutes.

"Who?"

"Daniel Okonkwo. Thirty-one. Accountant. He was there with his girlfriend—she's in surgery, but she'll make it."

Daniel Okonkwo. Thirty-one. Accountant.

She tried to picture him. Couldn't. He was a name and two facts now. An age and a job title. His girlfriend was in surgery and would wake up alone.

Ryu still hadn't turned around. The finger-drumming had stopped entirely, which was somehow worse.

"Ryu. You're being weird."

"I'm not—" He stopped. Started again. "I'm reviewing your cellular data, which requires—" Another stop. His hand came up to adjust his glasses, the slightly crooked ones he never quite fixed. "I got the upload."

There it was.

AR-Ryu had been with her the whole time—walking beside her through frozen chaos, telling her to stop, watching her wave her hand through his chest and keep going. Which meant Real-Ryu had received forty-seven minutes of—

Oh.

Oh, *shit*.

"You got the upload."

Ryu finally turned. His eyes were red-rimmed. Too bright.

"I received the full temporal suspension record, yes. All forty-seven minutes of it." The words started coming faster. "You were at eighty-nine percent when you started, and by minute thirty-one you were bleeding from your eyes—from your *eyes*, Ahdia—and your hands were shaking so badly you could barely lift that kid, Korede, and I watched you drag him to safety when you could barely stand, and I told you to stop, I told you *fourteen times*, I counted, and you just—" He made a gesture like he was waving through something. Through someone. "You kept walking. Like I wasn't there. Like what I was saying didn't—" He stopped. Took a breath. "Sorry. I'm doing it again."

Because he *wasn't* there. Because he was a projection. Because she'd known that if she stopped, Daniel Okonkwo wouldn't be the only name on the list.

But he didn't remember it as a projection. He remembered it as *him*. Forty-seven minutes of watching her kill herself in slow motion, unable to touch anything, unable to stop her.

Ruth stood. Moved to the IV cart. Picked up the autoinjector—sleek, medical-grade, the click-hiss kind.

"We need to start the treatment now. Your cells are destabilizing faster than projected."

She positioned it against Ahdia's arm. Thumb on the trigger.

*Click.*

The sound found her before she could brace for it.

*Hiss.*

Red light. Blue light. Her hand passing through the injector because she wasn't solid anymore. Firas's fingers on her wrist—the parts of her that were still *her*. The reversal. The flood. His lips moving over the roar: *Oh hey. I knew you were in there somewhere.*

Then Ruth's voice, and the ceiling, and the beeping.

She was gripping Ruth's wrist hard enough to leave marks. Her eyes were wet.

"Ahdia—"

"Sorry." Her voice cracked. "Sorry, I just—"

She let go. Saw the white pressure marks on Ruth's skin. Added *bruised my best friend* to the list of things she'd done today.

Ruth didn't pull away. Didn't flinch. Just watched her with that steady diagnostic gaze—reading her symptoms, cataloging her reactions, caring about her anyway.

"It's the sound," Ruth said quietly. Not a question. "The autoinjector."

Ahdia nodded. Couldn't speak.

Ryu had gone very still. "I didn't know," he said. "About Firas. What he did. The upload, it—I saw it. The memory."

He'd seen it. The one she'd been trying not to touch. Her brother's lips moving over the roar.

Firas was twenty-three. She was supposed to protect him. That was the deal—you're the older sibling, you protect them from bullies and bad decisions and singularities that want to eat them. She'd failed the only job that actually mattered.

"Now you do," she said. Barely audible.

Bourn's voice cut through from the doorway. "Dr. Ryu. Treatment status?"

Ryu blinked. Turned back to his monitors, fingers already drumming on the keyboard edge again.

"Cellular integrity stabilizing at sixty-eight percent. She'll need daily treatments for the next week instead of the usual three-day interval. I can have a revised protocol ready by—" He checked something. "Tomorrow morning. 0800."

"Noted." Bourn was already leaving. "Ms. Bacchus, Briefing Room C when you're mobile. The sooner the better—those movement patterns aren't going to analyze themselves."

The door hissed shut behind her.

Daniel Okonkwo. Thirty-one. Accountant.

Firas Bacchus. Twenty-three. Her little brother.

"Ahdia." Ruth's voice. "Look at me."

She looked.

"Twenty-three people are alive because of you. A little girl in a yellow dress went home to her family. Korede went home to Leta. You did that."

"And Daniel Okonkwo didn't go home to anyone."

His girlfriend was in surgery. She'd wake up and find out she came to a protest with her boyfriend and left alone.

Ruth held her gaze. Didn't flinch.

"No. He didn't. And that's not your fault."

*Isn't it?*

She didn't say it out loud. She didn't have to.

## Scene 3.5: County Lockup — Morning After

Leah had been sitting in the release area for three hours.

The plastic chair was designed by someone who hated human bodies. The fluorescent lights hummed at a frequency that made her teeth itch. A woman two seats down was crying quietly into her phone, and Leah was trying very hard not to eavesdrop while also memorizing every word because what else was she supposed to do with her brain at 7 AM in county lockup?

*He's fine. He's going to be fine. They would have called if he wasn't fine.*

Except they hadn't called. They hadn't called because Victor's phone was evidence, his earpiece was confiscated, and Leah had spent the last twelve hours working the system—calls to lawyers, calls to bail bondsmen, calls to that one guy from the ACLU who owed her a favor from the roller derby charity match.

The system was designed to make you wait. To make you feel small. To remind you that your person was in a cage somewhere behind those doors and there wasn't a damn thing you could do about it except sit in a plastic chair and wait.

She hated waiting.

The door buzzed. Leah was on her feet before it finished opening.

Victor came through slowly. Moving like someone had rearranged his internal organs and he was still figuring out the new layout. His left arm was in a sling—improvised, looked like torn shirt fabric. His face was wrong: swollen around one eye, a cut on his temple that had been cleaned but not properly treated, and that specific pallor of someone who'd spent the night on concrete.

"Hey." His voice came out rough. Sandpaper on gravel.

"Hey yourself." She wanted to run to him. Wanted to grab him and check every inch for damage. Instead she walked—controlled, steady, the way you approach someone who might flinch.

He didn't flinch. He leaned into her when she got close, just slightly, his weight shifting toward her like gravity had opinions.

"Shoulder?" she asked.

"Dislocated. They popped it back." A pause. "Eventually."

*Eventually.* She filed that away in the part of her brain that was keeping a list. The list was getting long.

"Can you walk?"

"Been walking all night. Standing's the hard part."

She got her arm under his—the good side—and took some of his weight. He let her. That scared her more than the bruises. Victor didn't let people carry him.

They made it to the parking lot. Her car was in the far corner because of course it was, because nothing about this night was designed to be easy. The morning sun was too bright, too cheerful, completely wrong for the occasion.

"The others?" Victor asked. First words since they'd started walking.

"Ahdia's at CADENS. Medical. She burned hard." Leah kept her voice neutral, reporting. "Ruth's with her. Ben's doing Ben things—running down the provocateurs."

"Tess?"

"Tracing the bot networks. She's convinced someone orchestrated the whole thing."

Victor made a sound. Not quite a laugh. "They did. Professional job. I've seen it before—agent provocateurs, coordinated escalation. Someone wanted that protest to turn violent."

"And the cops?"

"The cops did what cops do." His voice went flat. "Some of them were waiting for it. You could see it in their eyes—finally, permission. The others just... followed orders."

They reached the car. Leah helped him into the passenger seat, watched him wince when his shoulder moved wrong.

"Hospital," she said. "Now."

"Leah—"

"Don't." She got in the driver's side, slammed the door harder than necessary. "Don't tell me you're fine. Don't tell me it's not that bad. Don't tell me there's work to do."

"There *is* work to do. The community—"

"The community can wait four hours while someone who went to actual medical school looks at your shoulder." She started the engine. "You got beaten by four cops, Victor. Four. And you spent the night in holding because the system wanted to remind you who's in charge."

"I know who's in charge." His voice was quiet. "That's why I was there."

She pulled out of the parking lot. The city looked different in morning light—softer, almost innocent. Like it hadn't just chewed someone up and spit them out.

"What happened?" she asked. "After your comms went dark."

Victor was quiet for a moment. Watching the streets pass.

"I got the woman out. Her and the kid—they made it to the alley. Then..." He touched his shoulder, winced. "Four of them. I got two down before the third caught me. After that—" He shrugged with his good shoulder. "Holding cell. Concrete floor. Lot of time to think."

"Think about what?"

"About how many other people were in there with me. Protesters. Kids who'd never been arrested before. Old man who'd been at every civil rights march since '68." Victor's jaw tightened. "They kept us together. Let us talk. I think they wanted us scared, but instead—"

"Instead you organized."

A ghost of a smile. "Old habits."

*Of course he did.* Of course Victor Santos spent his night in county lockup building solidarity instead of sleeping. Of course he came out with new contacts, new intel, new understanding of how the system operated from the inside.

She loved him for it. She also wanted to shake him.

"The memorial's in three days," she said instead. "Geneva's speaking. Kain too."

"I know."

"You going to be functional by then?"

"I'll be functional." He looked at her—really looked, for the first time since the release door. "Leah. I'm okay."

"You're not okay. You're held together with stubbornness and scar tissue." She kept her eyes on the road. "But yeah. You'll be functional. You always are."

They drove in silence for a while. The city waking up around them—coffee shops opening, commuters starting their routines, everything pretending last night hadn't happened.

"The cops who did this," Leah said finally. "The ones who beat you."

"What about them?"

"I want their names."

Victor's hand found hers on the gear shift. Squeezed.

"Later," he said. "Right now—hospital. Then rest. Then we figure out who wanted this riot and why."

She squeezed back.

Later worked. For now.

## Scene 4: The Penthouse

There were people in her apartment.

She'd invited them. This was her idea. "Use the penthouse," she'd said, like a person who has people over. Like someone who does that regularly and doesn't find it deeply weird to have other humans breathing the same air as her.

Leah had her boots on the coffee table. Victor was leaning against the wall where Ahdia usually stood when she was dissociating at 3 AM. Ruth was in *her* spot on the couch—the spot with the perfect view of all four screens, the spot where the cushion had molded to the exact shape of Ahdia's depression.

This was what she wanted. Teammates. A team. People who showed up.

It was just... a lot. A lot of people. In her space. Existing near her.

She'd get used to it. Probably.

One of the screens was tuned to the news—she'd left it there, a habit, background noise that usually didn't require attention. But Kain's face kept pulling focus. Press conference. The riot still smoking in the B-roll behind him, all that chaos packaged into a campaign moment.

"—what we saw tonight was the failure of leadership to protect our citizens. The violence, the chaos—this is what happens when we let radical elements dictate the terms of public discourse—"

"I swear," Tess said, "I thought we murdered that guy."

Nobody laughed. Nobody disagreed. The words just sat there, heavy and true.

"He's campaigning." Ben's voice was flat. "He's literally campaigning on a riot he orchestrated."

"Can we mute that?" Ruth asked.

Ahdia turned it down but didn't kill it entirely. Kept Kain in her peripheral vision. Know your enemy.

Ben was pulling up something on his tablet, swiping through images. "The provocateurs weren't activists. Look at this—same boots on four different guys. Tactical footwear, not protest gear. They moved in formation. Entry points, dispersal patterns, timing on the gas—this was coordinated."

"So someone paid professionals to start a riot at a memorial for a dead kid." Tess's voice had that edge it got when she was too angry to sound angry.

"Someone with resources. Training protocols." Ben looked up. "And access to police response schedules."

Victor was quiet for a moment. He'd been quiet since they arrived—not his usual presence, the calm that anchored a room. Something smaller tonight.

"Isaiah deserved better than this," he said.

Nobody argued with that either.

Ruth leaned forward. "This isn't crime. This is political operation."

"So what, we're fighting... what?" Leah pulled her boots off the coffee table, finally. "A campaign?"

"We're fighting someone who can orchestrate a riot, control the police response, and turn it into a campaign ad within hours." Ruth's voice was steady, but Ahdia could hear the weight underneath. "That's not a criminal. That's—"

"Infrastructure." The word came out of Ahdia's mouth before she'd decided to say it. "Resources. People who follow orders."

Ruth nodded. "Okay. New parameters." She looked around the room—the room that wasn't hers, the room Ahdia had offered up like a normal person who did normal things. "Ben—keep pulling on the provocateur thread. I want names, funding sources, anything that connects back."

"On it."

"Tess—social media. Someone's controlling the narrative. Find out who's pushing the 'violent protesters' framing and trace it back."

Tess had her phone out before Ruth finished the sentence. "Already seeing bot patterns. Give me a few hours."

"Leah—activist networks. They need to know they're being infiltrated. Warn them without burning our own access."

"I know people." Leah was already standing. "I'll reach out."

"What about the community?" Victor's voice was quiet but firm. "Isaiah's family, the organizers—they're going to be blamed for this."

"That's on all of us." Ruth met his eyes. "We protect them how we can. But we can't fight the framing if we don't understand who's doing it."

Ruth paused. That pause—Ahdia knew that pause. It meant *there's more, and you're not going to like it*.

"There's something else." Ruth's voice shifted. Still steady, but different. The way she sounded when she was about to deliver bad news she'd already made peace with. "I heard from Bourn this morning."

The room went still. CADENS. Director Bourn. The shadow organization they'd stolen their gear from six months ago, back when "borrowed without asking" felt like the right phrase and not the lie it was.

"She could have called it theft," Ruth continued. "Federal charges. Asset recovery. All of it. Instead she's offering repairs. Upgrades. Legitimacy." A beat. "All she wants is for us to show up places she can't."

"That's a hell of an 'all she wants,'" Tess muttered.

"What kind of places?" Ben asked. His voice was neutral, tactical. Already calculating.

"Events where Geneva Windrow and Harding Kain intersect. CADENS has been logging anomalous EM readings every time they're in the same room. The riot. Campaign rallies. Press conferences." Ruth's jaw tightened. "They don't know what's causing it. They want eyes on the ground. Deniable eyes."

"And we're the deniable eyes." Victor's tone was flat. "Mercenary work for spooks."

"Contract work," Ruth corrected. "We stay independent. We choose which jobs we take. But yes—we're now on retainer for an organization that operates in the shadows and wants us to be their public face when things go sideways."

"Why us?" Leah asked. "They've got their own people."

"Because their own people can't be seen. CADENS is a shadow. If something goes wrong at a presidential debate and CADENS assets are involved, that's an international incident. If Go Squad is involved?" Ruth shrugged. "We're already vigilantes. We're already politically aligned with Geneva. We're already—"

"Expendable," Ahdia said.

Ruth didn't deny it.

"There's a debate in three days. Geneva versus Kain. First major face-to-face since the riot." Ruth looked around the room. "That's our first deployment. Security presence, officially. But really—"

"Really we're sensors." Ahdia felt the words come out flat. "I'm a sensor. My Seed reacts to whatever's causing those readings. That's why Bourn wants me there."

Ruth met her eyes. Didn't look away.

"Yes."

The silence stretched. Ahdia could feel the others looking at her—not with pity, not with judgment. Just that specific weight of people who knew they were about to ask you to do something dangerous and couldn't figure out how to feel about it.

"And Ahdia's treatment?" Ben asked quietly.

"Part of the deal." Ruth's voice was careful now. "Ryu continues her care. CADENS provides the resources. In exchange—"

"In exchange I show up and let them use my chest as a Geiger counter." Ahdia laughed, short and humorless. "Great. Love that for me."

"You don't have to—" Ruth started.

"Yeah, I do." Ahdia cut her off. "Because my treatment is non-negotiable, and you already said yes, and this is the price." She looked at Ruth—really looked. Saw the exhaustion underneath the leadership mask. The guilt she was trying not to show. "You made a deal with the devil to keep me alive. I'm not going to make you feel bad about it."

Ruth's expression flickered. Something like gratitude, something like pain.

"New gear is already on the way," she said. "CADENS-issued. Better than what we stole. Should arrive before the debate."

"Wonderful," Tess said. "I'm sure they won't install tracking devices or anything."

"They definitely will," Ben said. "I'll find them."

They were planning. Good. That's what teams did. They sat in each other's apartments and made deals with shadow organizations and assigned tasks and moved forward.

Ahdia should be part of this. She should be paying attention, contributing, being a teammate.

But her eyes kept drifting to the window.

The city at night, all those lights. All those people who went home safe because she'd held time still for forty-seven minutes.

Minus one.

Daniel Okonkwo. Thirty-one. Accountant.

She moved toward the window without really deciding to. The others were still talking—timelines, check-ins, next steps. She was half-listening.

The balcony doors were floor-to-ceiling glass. Best view in Caledonia. Her parents had paid for it, back when her parents were alive to pay for things. Now it was just hers—the view, the penthouse, the money, all of it bought with the price of people who didn't come home.

There was someone on that rooftop.

The building across the plaza—shorter than hers, but not by much. And on the roof, a figure. Standing at the edge. Looking this way.

Purple light. Flickering around the figure like lightning that forgot to strike.

She blinked. Moved closer to the glass.

That's not—

Who stands on a rooftop in the dark with purple lightning?

"Ahdia?" Ruth's voice, behind her. "You okay?"

She looked back. Just for a second.

Looked back at the rooftop.

Empty.

"Yeah." Her voice came out almost normal. "Just... tired."

The rooftop was empty. No figure. No lightning. Just the city, indifferent, going about its night.

She was seeing things. Forty-seven minutes of frozen time, one dead accountant, and now she was hallucinating watchers on rooftops.

Great. Very normal. Very stable.

"You should rest." Ruth had that tone—the medical one, the one that wasn't really a suggestion. "We've got the assignments covered. Ryu's got your treatment schedule—0800, don't skip it."

Rest. In her apartment. That currently had six people in it.

"I'll rest when you all leave."

"Hint taken." Leah was already heading for the door.

They filed out. One by one. Victor paused at the door, looked like he wanted to say something—probably something kind, something about Isaiah or the riot or the fact that she'd saved twenty-three people tonight. He didn't say it. Just nodded and left.

Tess gave her a look on the way out. Not comfort. Acknowledgment. *I see you. You're still standing. Good enough.*

Ben was already on his phone, pulling threads, the job more important than goodbyes.

And then they were gone.

And it was just her and the screens.

Kain's face, still talking. She'd muted him at some point, but she could read his lips. *Leadership. Safety. Order.* Words that meant nothing, words that meant everything, words that would be on campaign signs by morning.

The rooftop across the plaza. Empty.

Daniel Okonkwo. Thirty-one. Accountant.

She didn't turn off the screens. She sat on her couch—her couch again, finally, the cushion remembering her shape—and watched Kain's mouth move.

She didn't sleep.
