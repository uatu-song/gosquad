# Chapter 1: The Riot

## Scene 1: Downtown Caledonia - Peaceful Protest (Evening)

### Beat 1
**Rolls:** Environment (12), Ahdia State (14)

The sky on Feed 3 couldn't decide if it was evening or just giving up. Gray on gray, the kind of overcast that swallowed the sunset without announcing it.

Ahdia shifted in her chair, pulling her hoodie tighter around herself. The penthouse was cold—she kept it that way, easier to stay awake—and the glow from her wall of screens didn't help. Four drone feeds tiled across the main display: north approach, south approach, main plaza, crowd density overlay. Two thousand people, maybe more. Signs bobbing like a sea of cardboard: *Justice for Isaiah. Say His Name. Black Lives Matter.*

She flicked through the team's HUD feeds with a gesture.

Night Knight on the northwest rooftop, prone behind his scope. His feed showed the crowd from above, crosshairs drifting methodically across sections like he was reading a book. Old habits.

Gloom Girl and Battlea at street level, east side. Tess had her hood up, slouched against a wall like she was waiting for a bus. Leah beside her, arms crossed, trying too hard to look casual.

Nightingale was on the south rooftop, elevated position with full sightlines. Her feed showed the whole plaza laid out below—crowd, police line, side streets. The view of someone who needed to see everything to call the plays.

Crimson Sable's feed was the only one without a HUD overlay. Victor had insisted on civilian gear tonight—no suit, no mask, just a discreet earpiece. His camera angle came from his phone, half-pocketed, showing a cluster of young organizers he was talking to. Teaching them something, from the way they were nodding.

No one was breaking anything. No one was even shouting that loud.

"This is weird, right?" she said into comms. "We're just... watching people not commit crimes?"

### Beat 2

Nightingale's voice came through steady. "Protective presence, Auerbach. We're here if they need us."

"Unlike the fifty cops in riot gear who showed up to 'protect' them last time," Battlea muttered.

### Beat 4

She watched the feeds cycle through. Candles. Linked arms. A woman at the microphone talking about her son.

It looked like every protest montage she'd ever seen on cable news—the peaceful kind they always showed in retrospect, after something went wrong. *See how calm it was before?* Organized. Emotional. Zero molotov cocktails.

She waited for the other shoe to drop.

### Beat 5

"Clean so far." Night Knight's voice, clipped and professional. On his feed, the crosshairs panned across the crowd in slow sweeps. "Families, elderly folks. Not seeing agitators."

### Beats 6-8

"Sable, you good down there?" Night Knight asked, scope still sweeping.

"All quiet." Victor's voice was low, casual—blending in. "These kids know what they're doing. Better organized than half the nonprofits I've worked with."

"How are those boots holding up, Battlea?" Nightingale asked.

Battlea's sigh was audible. "I'm pretty sure CADENS sized these for someone with hooves."

"Mag-lock soles take adjustment. Give it another week."

"Easy for you to say. You got the medical sensors. I got clown shoes."

Gloom Girl's snort came through clear. "You literally asked for wall-climbing boots."

"I asked for *functional* wall-climbing boots. There's a difference."

### Beats 9-10

On the main plaza feed, someone started a call-and-response. *What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now.* The rhythm spread through the crowd like a wave. Fists raised. Candles flickering. A little girl on her father's shoulders, holding a sign she probably couldn't read yet.

This wasn't a riot waiting to happen. It was a community deciding to be seen.

Ahdia leaned back in her chair. Pulled her knees up. Watched.

First mission where nothing bad happens, she thought. Weird. But nice.

### Beat 11

6:47 PM.

"Nightingale, north perimeter." Night Knight's voice had changed. Flatter. "You seeing this?"

A pause. Then Ruth: "I see it."

Ahdia flicked to Feed 2. The police line on the north side—riot gear, batons, the whole theater of force. They'd been standing there for an hour. She didn't know what she was supposed to be seeing.

"What am I looking at?" she asked.

"Their hands," Nightingale said. "Watch their hands."

Ahdia watched. One cop adjusted his grip on his baton. Another shifted his weight forward. A third leaned toward the officer next to him, said something.

"The crowd hasn't changed," Night Knight said quietly. "They have."

### Beat 12

Ahdia glanced at the vitals overlay in the corner of her screen. Heart rates across the board were creeping up. Leah at 94—she was a derby jammer, usually sat in the low 60s. Tess at 89. Even Ben, prone and still behind his scope, was at 82.

"You guys all pre-game with espresso or something?" She meant it as a joke. "Ben, you're supposed to be the calm one."

"Maybe focus on the feeds, Auerbach." Night Knight's voice came back clipped. Not mean. Just... tight.

Ahdia blinked. Ben didn't snap. Ben was the steady one.

No one else said anything.

### Beat 13

She pulled back from the screens.

*Focus on the feeds.* Like she wasn't. Like she was just sitting here making jokes while they were out there actually doing something.

Firas would have been out there with them. Not watching from a bank of monitors in a cold penthouse, making dumb quips about espresso. He'd have been on a rooftop, or in the crowd with Victor, or—

She was the reason he wasn't. The reason he couldn't be.

The thought settled in her chest like it belonged there. *You're not a teammate. You're a replacement. A bad one.*

She shoved it down. Focused on the feeds.

### Beat 14

From somewhere in the murk of her own head, she almost missed it.

A man shoving someone on Feed 4. A woman yanking her kid back by the arm on Feed 1. Two teenagers squaring up where a banner used to be.

A minute ago these people were singing. What did she miss? Had she zoned out again?

"I'm seeing it too." Nightingale's voice, sharp now. "Something's moving through the crowd. Not physical—behavioral. It's spreading."

"From where?" Victor, low and urgent.

"I don't know. But we're not waiting to find out."

### Beats 15-17

"Nightingale, call it." Ben, done waiting.

"Battlea—north side, now. That police line's about to do something stupid."

Leah didn't need to be told twice. On her feed, Ahdia saw her plant her back foot, saw her mouth open—

The battle cry came through comms half a second before Ahdia felt the cold hit her chest.

She was already there. The Seed flaring, frost spreading through her ribs, and on Leah's feed the world went syrup-slow around her—just her, just that sliver of space—while FAERIS locked on and *pushed*.

Leah *moved*. Street level to the north barricade in the time it took a cop to blink. Sixty feet in maybe two seconds, if you were being generous with the math.

The cops didn't see her coming. That was the point.

Ahdia's fingers trembled on the console. The cold in her chest didn't fade—it settled. Made itself at home.

### Beat 18

"Knight—high ground, west side. I need overwatch on the crowd, not just the cops."

Ben was already in his crouch. That coiled, athletic stance that said *I'm about to do something physics doesn't approve of*.

She didn't wait for him to jump. Reached for the Seed before his feet left the rooftop—felt it answer, felt the cold sink deeper into her bones this time, settling in like it planned to stay.

On his feed, the air around Ben went thick and strange. FAERIS did the rest.

He launched off the northwest rooftop like gravity had personally offended him, arcing forty feet across the gap to the western tower. Landed in a roll, scope up before his knees touched concrete.

"Overwatch established." Cool as ever. Like he hadn't just jumped a canyon.

Ahdia flexed her fingers. They were slower to respond than they should have been.

### Beat 19

"Gloom Girl—rooftop across from Knight. I need a second angle on that police line."

Tess locked her gaze on the rooftop Ruth called. Then winked. Left eye.

The FAERIS drone pulsed once—reading her iris, calculating depth—and Tess was just *gone*. Reappeared on the rooftop half a second later, stumbling slightly on the landing.

"In position." A little breathless, but grinning. You could hear it in her voice.

"Still getting used to the new gesture," Ahdia said. "I miss the finger."

"Of course you do."

"Flipping the bird was a real statement. Now you're just coming on to the world."

"Very funny." Tess's voice had an edge. "Saying screw you is more your thing than mine, Auerbach."

### Beat 20

Silence on the line. Ahdia could see Tess's heart rate tick up another few points on the overlay.

"Auerbach, I didn't mean—" Tess started.

A sharp chirp cut her off. On Tess's feed, Ahdia watched her pull a handheld device from her utility belt—bulky, home-modded, covered in electrical tape and solder points.

"Hold on," Tess said. "I'm getting weird EM interference. The whole plaza."

Before Ahdia could ask, Battlea's voice cut through.

"Feed 4, northwest corner. Behind the dumpster."

Ahdia switched feeds. A figure in black bloc gear, face covered, crouched low. Hands busy with something.

"He's got a bottle," Battlea said.

"It's a protest," Ahdia said. "People bring water."

"He's stuffing a rag in it," Night Knight said.

"People bring... rags?"

"Lighter," Tess said.

"People bring—" The flame caught. "Shit."

"*Move,*" Nightingale said.
