# Chapter 9: Building the Case

## Scene 1: The Footage

Ben's apartment. 2 AM. Desk covered in files, multiple screens glowing, coffee cups forming geological strata.

The Tank Kain massacre footage played for the dozenth time. Frame by frame. Every angle he could find.

Six months since it happened. Fresh in public memory, fresher in his.

Kain running for President now. Campaign built on "tough choices" and "law and order." Using the massacre as proof he could make hard decisions.

Ben paused the footage. Advanced one frame. Back. Forward.

There.

The violence didn't start with protesters. He'd suspected it from the first viewing, but suspicion wasn't evidence.

A group moved through the crowd—body language wrong, positioning tactical. Not protesters. Not police. Something else.

He tracked them through multiple camera angles. Same group. Starting fires. Breaking windows. Throwing the first rock at the police line.

Protesters trying to stop them. Visible in the footage. Ordinary people grabbing arms, shouting "not like this."

None of that made the news.

Ben pulled up traffic camera records. CADENS clearance gave him access to things he shouldn't have.

Kain's armored vehicle. Positioned two blocks away. Arrived forty minutes before the protest started. Before any violence.

Either incredible foresight, or advance knowledge.

He cross-referenced police dispatch logs. No calls for armored support until after violence erupted. So who ordered the vehicle positioned early?

The requisition trail led to Kain's campaign security team. Not police. Not federal. Private.

Ben leaned back. Stared at the ceiling.

This was planned.

## Scene 2: The Pattern

Week two. Sleep becoming optional.

If Tank Kain was orchestrated, what else?

Ben searched news archives. Kain-connected violence over the past year.

Seven major riots. Every city Kain visited for campaign events. Every one followed the same pattern: peaceful protest, sudden violence, Kain's "decisive response."

Every one boosted his polling.

Either coincidence—statistically impossible—or systematic.

Ben tracked agent provocateurs through each incident. Different individuals, identical methods. Like they'd all trained from the same playbook.

The money trail appeared in week three. TRIOMF Solutions. Private security firm with minimal footprint, shell company ownership, offshore registration.

Large payments from Kain's campaign every month before a riot. "Event security." "Risk assessment." "Crisis management."

Ben documented everything. Timestamps. Sources. Chain of custody.

This was what he was good at. Building cases. Following evidence.

Not processing grief. Not healing. Just working.

Sarah would understand. She'd always understood that about him.

Sarah.

He pushed the thought away. Focused on the files.

## Scene 3: The FBI Meeting

FBI field office. Ben's former colleague, Agent Marcus Webb—different Webb, common name—reviewed the evidence.

"This is solid work." Webb flipped through the timeline analysis. "Tank Kain, the seven other incidents, TRIOMF connections..."

"It's systematic," Ben said. "Campaign-wide strategy."

"I see that." Webb closed the folder. "You know what happens if we investigate a presidential candidate."

"We do our jobs."

"We get eaten alive." Webb leaned forward. "Political pressure, media circus, career destruction. You sure you want that fight?"

"Evidence matters more than politics."

"Does it?" Webb's expression was unreadable. "Hope so. I'll take this to my supervisor. Preliminary review, see if we can get authorization for deeper investigation."

"Timeline?"

"Weeks. Maybe months." Webb shrugged. "This is proper procedure. Presidential campaign investigation requires Director-level approval, possibly DOJ."

Ben understood. He'd spent decades in the system. Knew how it worked.

The system worked. If you trusted it.

"One thing." Webb walked him out. "Kain has connections. Resources. Legal teams that specialize in burying investigations. If this moves forward, expect resistance."

"I'm not afraid of lawyers."

"You should be." Webb met his eyes. "I've seen good agents destroyed by political investigations. Just... eyes open."

Ben left with his evidence package delivered. Process begun.

The system would work.

Had to work.

## Scene 4: Fusion Discoveries

The TRIOMF trail branched in unexpected directions.

New expenditure series. Massive. Southwest facility acquisition—land, construction, specialized equipment. Different from riot funding.

Ben cross-referenced equipment manifests: magnetic coil arrays, plasma containment vessels, cooling systems.

Fusion reactor components.

Kain had announced the American Energy Independence Act same week. Artificial sun prototype. Type I civilization rhetoric. Ten months to operational prototype.

Scientists saying impossible in that timeline. Kain pushing anyway.

Ben dug deeper. Construction permits rushed. Environmental reviews incomplete. Safety inspections waived. EPA officials raising concerns, being overruled.

Same pattern as the riots. Cut corners. Prioritize speed. Ignore consequences.

But this time, the stakes were nuclear-level.

Catastrophic failure scenarios from academic papers: magnetic field collapse, plasma containment breach. Hundred million degrees released uncontrolled. Vaporization. Radiation. Environmental devastation for decades.

Ten months wasn't safe. Three to five years minimum, according to every expert not on Kain's payroll.

Ben added the fusion evidence to his case. Pattern of recklessness. Lives endangered for political optics.

Different goal—clean energy was genuinely good. But same methods. Same disregard for safety.

Same man.

## Scene 5: Sarah's Connection

Ben avoided Sarah's protest footage for weeks.

Finally, he couldn't.

Eight months ago. Different city. Different cause. Peaceful demonstration turned violent. Sarah caught in the crush.

Died helping someone else escape.

He watched the footage. Military precision applied to personal devastation.

Same tactical signature. Agent provocateurs. Coordinated violence.

Not Kain's agents specifically—different campaign event, different target. But same playbook. Same methods.

Sarah died from riot orchestration tactics. Manufactured crisis for someone's political gain.

Her death wasn't random tragedy.

It was murder by algorithm.

Ben sat on his kitchen floor for an hour. Grief and rage merging into something harder than either.

Then he got back to work.

## Scene 6: Submission and Hope

Morning. Case complete. Professional presentation, federal investigation standard.

Everything sourced. Everything verified. Evidence of systematic campaign violence, pattern recognition across incidents, financial connections to TRIOMF, fusion project safety violations.

And Sarah.

He didn't emphasize the personal connection. Wanted this about justice, not vendetta.

Though of course it was both.

Ben showered. Shaved. Put on proper clothes.

The evidence package fit in a single briefcase. Months of work. Thousands of hours. Everything.

Ruth's text appeared: *Team meeting tomorrow. Will you be there?*

He typed back: *Yes. Will explain everything soon.*

He'd return as a hero. Case delivered. Conspiracy exposed. Kain stopped.

Sarah's death given meaning.

Walking to the FBI office, briefcase in hand, Ben felt hope for the first time in eight months.

The system would work.

The evidence was undeniable.

Truth would matter.

---

He didn't know yet.

Month 8, the evidence would leak.

Month 9, Kain's polling would rise. "Decisive action." "Hard choices." The evidence reframed as strength.

Month 12, Kain would win anyway.

But Ben didn't know that yet.

He still had hope.

He still believed.
