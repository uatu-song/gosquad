d# Chapter 4: Dependencies

## Scene 1: The Call

The hologram room was designed for secrets.

Soundproofed walls, signal encryption that would take a quantum computer decades to crack, no windows, no witnesses. Harriet Bourn had held conversations in this room that would have ended careers, toppled governments, prevented wars no one would ever know almost happened.

Today she stood alone, waiting for a call she'd been dreading for weeks.

The projector hummed. Light coalesced into the shape of a man in a Pentagon office—Secretary of Defense Patterson, his face arranged in the careful neutrality of someone about to threaten you politely.

"Director Bourn."

"Mr. Secretary." She matched his tone. "To what do I owe the pleasure?"

"Cut the civility. We both know why I'm calling."

Bourn waited. She'd learned decades ago that the person who speaks first in these conversations loses.

"Geneva Windrow," Patterson said. "You had CADENS assets investigating her assassination."

"Consultation at the request of local law enforcement—"

"Consultation. With your enhanced assets. Off the books."

Bourn's face stayed neutral. So Patterson had been monitoring CADENS activity. That wasn't surprising. What was surprising was that he was admitting it.

"CADENS operates with near-total autonomy," Patterson continued. "Defense doesn't get briefed. Intelligence doesn't get briefed. You answer to one person—the President—and even that's more courtesy than requirement."

"Our charter is Presidential. That's been the arrangement for forty years."

"Your charter is a blank check written by an administration that's about to change."

There it was. The threat, finally visible.

"CADENS answers to whoever holds the office," Bourn said carefully. "That hasn't changed."

"Then you should be very interested in who that might be next year."

Bourn felt the calculation happening—Patterson backing Kain, or at least hedging his bets. The polls had Kain up eight points since Geneva's death. The smart money was already shifting.

"When oversight finally comes," Patterson said, "and it will come—CADENS will answer to more than just one person."

"Oversight. Or control?"

"Is there a difference?"

"CADENS was designed to operate independently for a reason—"

"To avoid accountability. Yes, I've read the documentation."

"To avoid *political* accountability. Cataclysm-derived threats don't wait for committee approval."

"And who decides what qualifies as 'cataclysm-derived'? You? Personally?"

Bourn couldn't argue that point. She did have unilateral authority on threat classification. She'd designed it that way, back when she trusted herself completely.

"One person with access to cosmic-level weapons," Patterson said, "operating in secret, answering to no oversight. Tell me, Director—how is that different from dictatorship?"

"Because I can be fired by the President. Tomorrow. With one signature."

"And if the President doesn't fire you? Then what? Who stops you?"

Silence. The question hung in the recycled air.

"Do you know how many defense initiatives get killed in committee?" Patterson leaned forward. "Budget fights? Authorization deadlocks? Meanwhile, CADENS gets blank checks, black sites, and carte blanche."

"Because we deal with threats you can't classify, understand, or contain through conventional means."

"Or because you've convinced every administration you're indispensable."

Bourn felt something shift in her chest. Not guilt, exactly. Recognition. Patterson wasn't wrong about everything.

"I'm recommending CADENS reform to Kain's transition team," Patterson said. "Oversight. Accountability. Transparency where possible."

"You'll compromise operational security—"

"I'll compromise your operational *autonomy*. There's a difference."

"Not when threats move faster than oversight committees."

"Then maybe CADENS needs to move slower. More carefully. More accountably."

"Or maybe Defense needs to accept that some threats require trust."

Patterson's expression went cold. "Trust is earned, Director. And you haven't earned mine."

The hologram flickered and died. Patterson disappeared, leaving Bourn alone in a room designed for secrets.

She stood in the dark for a long moment.

*Is he wrong?*

CADENS did operate with no oversight except Presidential. She did have unilateral authority. And if Kain became President—a man who'd integrated a cosmic artifact into his chest and become a kaiju, who'd caused forty-seven deaths and blamed the victims—he would control everything she'd built.

The system she designed to prevent catastrophe could be weaponized by whoever controlled the Presidency.

She'd made CADENS powerful to protect America. What if that power was turned against it?

Bourn pulled up a display—CADENS operations, enhanced individuals program, translocation tech, cataclysm research. All of it accessible to the President. All of it could be used for oppression, surveillance, control.

She'd designed it for defense. Kain could use it for offense.

And she couldn't refuse Presidential orders without violating the CADENS charter. Without becoming exactly what Patterson accused her of being—an unaccountable dictator.

The cage became visible. Different from the one holding Ahdia Bacchus. Same bars.

## Scene 2: The Alley

Victor had been doing this work for fifteen years.

Community organizing, mutual aid, showing up when showing up mattered. He'd faced cops, fascists, corporate security. He'd buried a wife—Clara, shot during a protest that turned violent, five years ago now—and kept going. Grief didn't stop the work. The work was what you did instead of drowning.

Tonight felt different. Wrong in a way he couldn't name.

The streets were quieter than usual for a Thursday. Shops closing early, metal gates rattling down. People walking faster, heads down. A woman crossed the street to avoid passing him on the sidewalk—actually crossed the street, like he was a threat.

He was wearing civilian clothes. Jeans, hoodie, nothing that said "vigilante." Just a Black man walking through his own neighborhood, the same neighborhood where he'd organized food drives and voter registration and community defense trainings.

That used to be enough.

*Something's off. The air feels thick. Heavy.*

His earpiece crackled.

"Victor, you're near Fifth and Morrison." Ruth's voice, steady as always. "We're getting reports of a disturbance—sounds like a mugging in progress."

"On it. Two blocks out."

He picked up his pace. This was the work. Someone needed help. You showed up.

The alley behind the bodega was dark, lit only by a flickering security light that probably hadn't been serviced since the Bush administration. The first Bush. Victor saw the shapes before he heard the voices—two figures, one pressed against the wall, one looming.

"Hey." He stepped into the alley, keeping his voice calm. "Everything okay here?"

The looming figure turned. Young guy, maybe twenty, face twisted with something that looked like fear pretending to be anger. Victor knew the look—had seen it on a hundred faces at protests, at community meetings, at funerals. Fear that had nowhere to go except out.

"Mind your business."

"I'm making it my business." Victor kept his hands visible, non-threatening. "You okay back there?"

The person against the wall—a woman, older, clutching her purse like it contained her whole life—nodded frantically.

"Why don't you step back and let her go."

The young man's hand twitched toward his pocket. Could be a weapon, could be nothing. Victor tracked the movement, calculating. He'd de-escalated a hundred situations like this. Read the body language, find the fear underneath the aggression, give them a way out that didn't require violence.

"Who the hell are you?" The young man's voice was rising. "Some kind of hero?"

"Just someone who lives here. Same as you."

Something shifted in the young man's eyes. The fear-anger flickered, and for a second Victor thought he'd gotten through—

Then the woman screamed.

Not at the young man. At Victor.

"That's one of them! The vigilantes! He's one of them!"

Victor's blood went cold.

"Ma'am, I'm trying to help you—"

"Help?" She was backing away now, pressing herself against the wall like he was the threat. "You people are the problem! You brought this on us! The riots, the violence—"

"I wasn't at the—"

But she wasn't listening. She was screaming, and now there were other sounds—footsteps, voices, people emerging from doorways. The young man had vanished, forgotten. The woman kept screaming.

"Is that Crimson Sable?"

"The vigilante? Get him!"

Victor's training kicked in. Count the threats. Find the exits. Don't engage civilians.

Except the civilians were engaging him.

A man grabbed his arm—shop owner, Victor realized, someone he'd helped with a permits issue last year. Victor twisted free gently, no force, just redirection. But the man stumbled, and someone else shouted "He's attacking us!"

More hands. More bodies. The crowd was maybe fifteen people now, faces he might have recognized last week. Neighbors. Shop owners. Parents from the community center where he'd taught de-escalation workshops.

All of them looking at him like he was the enemy.

*This isn't right. These people know me. I've helped them.*

Someone threw a punch. Victor ducked, but another fist caught his shoulder. He could fight back—his training was better than theirs—but these weren't enemies. These were scared people, and hitting them would make everything worse.

"Ruth, I need extraction." He kept his voice level, which took more effort than blocking punches. "Fifth and Morrison, alley behind the bodega. Civilians have turned—it's like they're not themselves."

"Turned? What do you mean *turned*?"

"I mean they're trying to kill me and I don't think they know why."

A bottle shattered against the wall near his head. The crowd was growing—twenty people now, maybe more. Victor backed toward the alley's dead end, which was exactly the wrong direction, but the street was blocked by bodies.

*Fifteen years. Fifteen years of building trust. And they're looking at me like I'm a monster.*

He saw the knife a second before it would have opened his throat.

Grabbed the wrist, redirected, watched the blade clatter away. The attacker's face was blank with terror—not anger, Victor realized. Fear. They were all afraid. Desperately, irrationally afraid.

Of him.

"Something's amplifying their fear," he said into comms. "This isn't natural."

"Leah's en route. Two minutes."

"I might not have two minutes."

The fire escape to his left was rusted but climbable. He'd have to go through the crowd to reach it—and they'd have to choose not to follow.

Victor ran.

Three steps, four, feeling hands grab at his jacket. He jumped, caught the ladder, hauled himself up as fingers scraped at his ankles. The rust bit into his palms. He climbed.

Below, the crowd milled, confused. Whatever had gripped them was fading—he could see it in their faces, the fear flickering to bewilderment. They looked at each other, at their own hands, at the blood on Victor's jacket.

"What... what happened?"

Victor reached the rooftop. Sat down hard. His hands were shaking.

Fifteen years of building trust. One night of whatever that was.

And he hadn't even done anything wrong.

"I'm clear," he said into comms. "Rooftop on Morrison. But Ruth—we need to talk about what just happened. Something turned those people. Something made them afraid of me."

"Come in. We'll debrief."

Victor looked down at the street. The crowd was dispersing, people wandering away like sleepwalkers waking up. None of them would remember why they'd attacked him. None of them would understand.

But he would remember their faces. Every single one.

## Scene 3: Neutral Ground

Ruth had been to CADENS headquarters exactly once—the day they'd recruited Firas, back when everything was simpler. Back when he was alive.

This wasn't headquarters. This was a satellite facility, a converted warehouse on the edge of the industrial district. "Neutral ground," Director Bourn had called it in her message.

Ruth didn't believe in neutral ground. Every space belonged to someone.

The door was guarded by a single agent who checked her credentials without speaking. Inside, the warehouse had been converted into something that looked almost cozy—leather couches, a coffee station with an espresso machine, soft lighting that probably cost more than Ruth's monthly rent. It looked like someone's idea of what a spy would want for a private meeting. Spy aesthetic. Safe house chic.

Director Bourn was already there, standing by the coffee station like she'd been waiting. Older than Ruth expected from her file—late fifties, silver hair cut short, the kind of stillness that came from decades of power. The stillness of someone who didn't need to move to get what she wanted.

"Dr. Carter." Warm voice. Practiced warmth. "Thank you for coming."

"Your message said it was urgent."

"Please, sit. Coffee? It's better than it looks."

Ruth sat. Didn't take the coffee. Watched Bourn pour herself a cup and settle into the chair opposite with the ease of someone who'd had a thousand conversations in rooms like this.

"I'll get straight to the point," Bourn said. "I've been following your team's work. Impressive, given your resources."

"We manage."

"You do more than manage. You've built something real. A team that trusts each other, that shows up, that does the work." Bourn sipped her coffee. "That's rare."

Ruth waited. Compliments from people like Bourn always had a second half.

"I also know you're carrying a load that would break most people. Team leader. Medical officer. Primary treatment provider for your temporalist. Grief counselor, apparently, based on what I've observed."

Ruth went still. "You've been observing us?"

"CADENS monitors enhanced individuals. It's not surveillance—it's protection. For you as much as anyone."

"That's a distinction I'm not sure I buy."

Bourn smiled—small, acknowledging. "Good. You shouldn't buy it automatically. Question everything, Dr. Carter. That's what makes you valuable."

Ruth felt the manipulation happening—the flattery, the acknowledgment of her suspicion, the subtle framing of CADENS as ally rather than threat. She'd seen doctors do this with families. Build trust before delivering bad news.

"What do you want, Director?"

"I want to help. And I think you could use help."

"Help with what?"

"Everything." Bourn set down her cup. "Resources. Intel. Institutional backing. Your team is doing important work with no support, no budget, no protection. I can offer all three."

"In exchange for?"

"Coordination. Not control—I know the difference, and I suspect you do too. But coordination. Sharing information. Working together instead of at cross purposes."

Ruth's instincts were screaming warnings. This was recruitment. This was co-optation. This was exactly how institutions absorbed grassroots movements—offer help, create dependency, slowly turn "coordination" into control.

But something else was happening too. A tired part of her, the part that had been holding everything together for months, heard "help" and wanted to believe it.

"Why me?" she asked. "Why not approach the whole team?"

"Because you're the leader. And because..." Bourn paused. Set down her coffee. "Because I see something in you that I recognize. Someone who takes responsibility. Who can't stop taking responsibility, even when the weight is crushing."

That landed. Ruth felt it in her chest, right where she'd been carrying Firas's death, Geneva's death, Ahdia's slow decay.

"I've been that person for forty years," Bourn continued. "Leading CADENS, protecting people from threats they can't imagine. And I've learned something important: you can't do it alone. Not forever. The weight breaks you eventually, unless you let other people help carry it."

"Is this a recruitment pitch?"

"This is an offer. A partnership." Bourn leaned forward, and her face was different now—less practiced, more real. Or a better performance of real. Ruth couldn't tell anymore. "You keep your independence, your team, your methods. But you have CADENS behind you when you need it. Resources, intel, backup. No strings—or at least, strings you can see and cut if you don't like them."

Ruth wanted to say no. Wanted to walk out, maintain the clean separation between her team and the shadow agencies that had taken Firas into a singularity and never brought him back.

But she was so tired. And Bourn was right about the weight.

"I'll think about it."

Bourn nodded—not pushing, not triumphant. Just accepting. "That's all I ask. Here's my direct line." She handed Ruth a card. Plain, just a phone number. No name, no title. "No intermediaries. Call me when you're ready to talk more."

Ruth took it. Put it in her pocket.

She told herself she was keeping her options open. She told herself this didn't change anything.

Walking out of the warehouse, she felt something she hadn't felt in months: the faint, dangerous sensation of not being alone.

*Be careful*, a voice in her head said. It sounded like Firas. *Be careful what you reach for.*

But the card was already in her pocket. The door was already open.

And Ruth was so tired of carrying everything by herself.
