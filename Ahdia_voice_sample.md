# AHDIA VOICE MACHINE

Purpose: Load before generating Ahdia POV prose. This is the voice. Match this energy, use these tools.

## PART 1: PROSE SAMPLES

### Pattern A: Processing Trauma Through Pop Culture

When she found him on the bathroom floor, gripping his midsection like he was literally holding his guts in, her brain did that thing where it cycled through every movie death scene she'd ever watched. This is fine. Totally fine. Just like that Grey's Anatomy episode. Except real. And my brother.

Okay, dying brother says no hospital. In literally every crime show on USA Network at 2 AM, this is when you find out your family member is in witness protection or running a meth empire. Was Firas a criminal now? Did he owe money to someone? Was this some Breaking Bad situation where her engineer parents' legacy skipped her and went straight to pharmaceutical crime?

### Pattern B: Absurdity Through Mundane Comparisons / Weird Specifics

Ruth's door was unlocked. Which, okay, what the hell? You fight crime at night and you don't lock your door?

Leah Turner. Battlea. The Bean Post barista who also happened to be a roller derby jammer, which Ahdia only knew because she'd watched that Ellen Page movie about roller derby at 3 AM once while eating an entire box of Thin Mints.

Tess Whitford. Tiny studio, window cracked open on the fire escape. Prescription bottle on the bathroom sink: Sertraline 100mg. Ahdia knew that one. Hadn't helped her either. Tess was asleep on a futon, still in her work clothes. Another depressed girl just trying to make rent. Yeah. Ahdia got it.

### Pattern C: Humor Under Pressure

Great. She had cosmic superpowers and they were literally killing her. Very on-brand for her luck.

She tried snapping her fingers, clapping, even doing a little dance she'd seen on TikTok once. The world stayed frozen.

"Oh shit!" But also—"Yes!"

"I contain multitudes." She grinned. "Also I watched a lot of anime at 4 AM when sleep wouldn't come."

### Pattern D: The Tangent King (Specific Weird References)

She was pot-committed, just like the time Phil Hellmuth was in the World Series of Poker she saw on ESPN. The commentator said that it was a fallacy, she remembered, that you can always back out no matter how much you commit and often, that's the best play, but in that moment, that felt like nonsense.

After four momentum building strides, she timed her leap when she got to the very edge as though she were bowling, thinking about the Professional Bowlers Association broadcasts she watched on ESPN2 while drinking Pabst Blue Ribbons.

## PART 2: REFERENCE STRUCTURE VARIATION

**THE PROBLEM:** Every pop culture reference as a simile ("like X," "the kind of X that") becomes formulaic. It reads as decoration, not cognition.

**THE FIX:** Vary the structure. Her brain doesn't always compare—sometimes it interrupts, questions, supplies, or just does.

### The Six Shapes

**1. Direct brain narration**
> Her brain did that thing where it cycled through every movie death scene she'd ever watched.

**2. Question format**
> Was this some Breaking Bad situation where her engineer parents' legacy skipped her and went straight to pharmaceutical crime?

**3. Embedded parenthetical (brain supplying unhelpfully)**
> —Mola Ram, her brain supplied, completely unhelpfully—

**4. Tangent that just exists**
> Korede running toward tear gas like he was trying out for a Darwin Award—

No framing. No "like." Just the reference as observation.

**5. Memory/knowledge disclosure**
> which Ahdia only knew because she'd watched that Ellen Page movie about roller derby at 3 AM once while eating an entire box of Thin Mints.

**6. Self-interruption**
> That specific beeping rhythm that said you're alive but we're monitoring the situation. Like a hospital episode of—no, focus.

### Rule

No more than two simile-format references ("like X") per scene. Try other shapes first.

## PART 3: NON-REFERENCE VOICE TOOLS

These are equally important. The pop culture is one instrument. These are the rest of the orchestra.

### 1. Repetition Loops
Her brain stutters under load. Words repeat as processing.
> "Okay. Okay okay okay."
> "This is fine. Totally fine."
> "Oh god, oh god, oh god!"

Use during: overwhelm, disorientation, panic, forcing herself to accept something.

### 2. Self-Interrupting Dashes
Thoughts cut into themselves. Mid-sentence pivots.
> "—great time to appreciate the square footage, Ahdia—"
> "—which, okay, wasn't technically a question, but the subtext was pretty clear—"

Use when: her brain comments on itself, adds sarcasm, notices something mid-thought.

### 3. Unresolved Questions
She asks herself things and leaves them hanging. No resolution. No comfort.
> "Isn't it? She didn't say it out loud. She didn't have to."

Never answer these. Let them sit.

### 4. Shared Damage Recognition
She sees herself in other people's brokenness. Not pity—recognition.
> "Prescription bottle on the bathroom sink: Sertraline 100mg. Ahdia knew that one. Hadn't helped her either."
> "Another depressed girl just trying to make rent. Yeah. Ahdia got it."

Use when: observing teammates, strangers, anyone struggling with something she knows.

### 5. Flat Dark Statements
She states terrible things without softening. No euphemism.
> "headed back to her luxury perch brought to her by dead parents"
> "the last time she worried about missing family members, she was punished with unlimited funds and the lap of luxury"

The flatness IS the emotion. Don't add commentary.

### 6. Counting/Quantifying
Numbers give her something to hold. Quantifying feels like control.
> "this was his 64th such engagement since he started doing patrols"
> "Twenty-three people. She'd saved twenty-three people."

Use during: crisis, guilt, trying to make sense of chaos.

### 7. Both/And Contradictions
Two reactions at once. Neither cancelled.
> "Oh shit!" But also—"Yes!"

Her emotional states coexist. Don't resolve them into one feeling.

### 8. External Observation Deflecting Internal Feeling
She notices posture, hands, face arrangements—instead of narrating her own emotions directly.
> "His face was controlled, professional—but his eyes were wrong. Too bright."
> "The rigid line of his shoulders"

She sees others to avoid seeing herself.

## PART 4: ANTI-PATTERNS

What Ahdia does NOT do:

- **Resolve her own questions with comfort.** She asks "Isn't it?" and leaves it there.
- **Explain her feelings directly.** She doesn't say "I felt guilty." She counts the dead.
- **Use clean prose that stays on topic.** Her brain wanders. Let it.
- **Process efficiently.** Repetition loops, tangents, interruptions—that's the process.
- **Make references for the reader's entertainment.** References are coping, not performance.
- **Soften dark statements.** "Dead parents" not "parents who passed away."
- **Land on single emotions.** Both/and, not either/or.

## PART 4B: GENERATION ARTIFACTS TO AVOID

These are patterns that emerge from LLM prose generation. They're tells. Cut them in revision.

### 1. Triple-Adjective Staccato
> ❌ "His voice was flat. Professional. Wrong."
> ❌ "Measured, but tight underneath."
> ❌ "Neutral and assessing."

This rhythm works once per scene, maybe twice. More than that and it becomes mechanical—the generation process reaching for a reliable shape instead of finding the specific one.

**Fix:** Vary the rhythm. Use action, observation, or a single precise word instead.
> ✓ "He was reading data, not talking to her."

### 2. Restated Emotional Beats
> ❌ "His eyes were wrong. Too bright. The look of someone who'd been holding something in for hours."
> Then later: "Something in his face clicked back to professional mode."

Tracking the same internal state multiple ways in close proximity. Prose wants compression—hit it once, hit it hard, move on.

**Fix:** Pick the strongest beat. Cut the others or space them further apart.
> ✓ "His eyes were wrong. Too bright."

### 3. Thesis Statements
> ❌ "The math didn't balance. The math was never going to balance."

Explaining what the scene already showed. Doing the reader's work for them. If Daniel Okonkwo's details carry the weight, the thesis line is redundant.

**Fix:** Cut the thesis. Trust the scene to land.

### 4. Over-Explained Brain Activity
> ❌ "Her brain did that thing where it tried to match the visual to something familiar—hospital shows, medical dramas..."

Showing your work. The reference is the brain matching; you don't need to narrate that it's matching.

**Fix:** Just do the thing.
> ✓ "Too white. Too still. No smoke, no frozen faces, no purple tint."

### 5. Hedge Constructions
> ❌ "something that looked like understanding"
> ❌ "The kind of pause that meant..."

Distancing language that softens the observation. Sometimes appropriate, but overuse creates mushy prose.

**Fix:** Commit or cut.
> ✓ "Understanding" or just show the behavior and let the reader name it.

## PART 5: FREQUENCY GUIDELINES

Per scene (rough targets, not rigid rules):

| Tool | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Simile-format references ("like X") | Max 2 |
| Other-shape references | 2-4 |
| Repetition loops | At least 1 per high-stress moment |
| Self-interrupting dashes | 2-4 |
| Unresolved questions | At least 1 |
| Flat dark statements | 1-2 |
| Counting/quantifying | When crisis or guilt present |
| Both/and contradictions | When emotional complexity present |

If a scene has 8 simile references and 0 repetition loops, something's wrong.

## PART 6: THE TEST

After generating Ahdia POV prose, ask:

**Voice Check:**
1. Could this have been written about any protagonist? (If yes, voice is missing)
2. Are all references similes? (If yes, vary structure)
3. Does she resolve her own questions? (If yes, delete the resolution)
4. Is there a tangent? (If no, her brain is too focused)
5. Is there a repetition loop during stress? (If no, add one)
6. Does she state something dark without softening? (If no, find where to flatten)

**Artifact Check:**
7. Count the triple-adjective staccatos. More than 2 per scene? (If yes, vary rhythms)
8. Is any emotional state described more than once in close proximity? (If yes, compress)
9. Is there a thesis statement explaining what the scene showed? (If yes, cut it)
10. Any "her brain did that thing where" constructions? (If yes, just do the thing)
11. Count hedge phrases ("something like," "the kind of"). More than 2? (If yes, commit or cut)

## PART 7: NARRATOR VOICE (Distinct from Dialogue)

The narrator in Ahdia POV is NOT neutral prose. It's her internal perception performed as description. These samples show narrator voice specifically—scene-setting, observation, description—filtered through her brain.

### Narrator Voice Samples

**Environmental observation through her lens:**
> The sky on Feed 3 couldn't decide if it was evening or just giving up.

> The penthouse was cold—she kept it that way, easier to stay awake.

> The overhead lights did that thing where they couldn't decide between "interrogation room" and "sad municipal building."

**Describing other characters through her biases:**
> Ben sat in the middle of what looked like a serial killer's evidence board, papers spread around him like he was planning a heist or a nervous breakdown.

> Tess came through the side door with her laptop bag, that specific posture of someone who expected an empty room and got ambushed by human interaction.

> Victor paused at the door, looked like he wanted to say something—probably something kind, something about Isaiah or the riot or the fact that she'd saved twenty-three people tonight. He didn't say it. Just nodded and left.

**Space described through emotional state:**
> Ruth was in *her* spot on the couch—the spot with the perfect view of all four screens, the spot where the cushion had molded to the exact shape of Ahdia's depression.

> It was just... a lot. A lot of people. In her space. Existing near her.

**Technical details through engineering-dropout lens:**
> That specific beeping rhythm that said *you're alive but we're monitoring the situation*.

> *CELLULAR INTEGRITY: 86%.* Blood dripped from her nose.

**Flat narrator statements (no softening):**
> Her parents had paid for it, back when her parents were alive to pay for things. Now it was just hers—the view, the penthouse, the money, all of it bought with the price of people who didn't come home.

> Daniel Okonkwo. Thirty-one. Accountant.

**Self-aware narrator (knows her own limitations):**
> In the hallway—not that Ahdia could see it, but she knew the posture anyway—Tess would be doing that thing.

> The math wasn't complicated. The math was never complicated. It was the part where you had to feel it that got you.

### Narrator Voice Rules

1. **Not omniscient.** She can only describe what she perceives or reasonably infers.
2. **Biased observation.** Other characters filtered through her judgments, fears, projections.
3. **Rhythm matches state.** Choppy sentences = anxiety. Flowing = dissociation. Fragments = overwhelm.
4. **Details reveal attention.** What she notices (coffee rings, cushion shapes) vs. what she misses (social cues).
5. **Dark without commentary.** State the terrible thing. Don't explain why it's terrible.

### The Narrator Test

After writing narrator prose, ask:
- Could a neutral camera see this? (If yes, add Ahdia's filter)
- Is this objective description? (If yes, bias it through her perception)
- Does the rhythm match her current emotional state?
- Is there at least one detail only she would notice?
- Is there at least one thing she's probably missing?

## REMEMBER

Ahdia's brain is messy, specific, deflective, and darkly funny. The references are coping mechanisms, not decoration. The tangents are how she processes. The repetition is how she stutters under load. The flat statements are where the real pain lives.

**The narrator IS Ahdia.** Not a camera filming her. Her eyes, her attention, her damage, her humor. Let it be.
