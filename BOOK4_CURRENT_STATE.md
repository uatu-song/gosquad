## Recommended TTRPG Generation Order

### **Phase 1: The Between Arc (6-8 chapters)**
Generate chapters covering Ahdia's journey from stranded → meeting Suzie:
- Survival challenges
- AR-Ryu companionship
- Visor battery anxiety
- Ancient ruins exploration
- First kaiju encounter
- Meeting Suzie
- Bond formation before Chapter 31

### **Phase 2: Rescue Operation (4-5 chapters)**
Generate Earth-side rescue mission:
- Journey to artificial sun
- Diplomatic hurdles
- Rift preparation
- Signal reception
- Opening rift
- Waiting for response

### **Phase 3: Aftermath (3-4 chapters)**
Generate post-reunion content:
- Landing scene
- Grief processing
- Team integration
- Book 4 climax
- Book 5 setup

### **Phase 4: Parallel Timelines (scattered inserts)**
Generate missing Korede, Tess, Ben & Leah chapters:
- Insert throughout Acts 2-3
- Provide parallel tension
- Show team functioning separately
- Build to convergence

---

## Total Estimate

**Current:** 15 chapters (1-14, 31)
**Needed:** ~15-20 more chapters (15-30, 32-35)
**Target Total:** ~30-35 chapters for Book 4

**TTRPG Campaign Strategy:**
1. Focus on The Between arc first (Ahdia-centric, most critical)
2. Generate rescue operation (Earth team, builds to Chapter 31)
3. Generate aftermath (post-31, completes book)
4. Fill parallel timelines (Korede, Tess, Ben & Leah details)

---

## Next Step

**Run TTRPG campaigns to generate missing chapters using emergent dice-based storytelling.**

Start with: **The Between Arc (Ahdia's survival and meeting Suzie)**
- Set up scenarios in The Between
- Roll for survival challenges, discoveries, encounters
- Let dice generate organic complications and costs
- Build toward Chapter 31's established endpoint
