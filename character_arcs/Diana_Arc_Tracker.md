## Character Foundation

### Basic Info
- **Name:** Diana (chosen name), also called Ahdia Prime or Prime
- **Origin:** Universe Cycle 3 (Suzie's world - the "almost utopia" that ended)
- **Nature:** The ORIGINAL Ahdia who cycled forward through three universal deaths
- **Age:** Same as Ahdia-4 chronologically, but experienced three universe cycles
- **Status:** Only continuous consciousness across multiple universal cycles

### Core Tragedy: The Truth of Cyclic Time
- Diana didn't come from a "parallel timeline"
- She came from **three universes ago**
- She rode the death and rebirth of reality three times
- Watched three versions of herself be born, grow up, gain powers
- Watched three universes END - not erased, but cosmic death
- The Ahdias she "left behind" didn't get erased - they experienced universal death
- "The only Prime to survive" = the only continuous consciousness across cycles
- "I have always been alone" = not dramatic, literal - everyone she knew died with their universe, multiple times

### Powers & Capabilities
- Full Hyper Seed connection (like Ahdia-4)
- Temporal powers at full strength (never degraded)
- Deep understanding of dimensional mechanics
- Studied transcendence (prepared for this)
- Both/and thinking perfected (learned through iterations)

### Personality
- Sculpts reality rather than mourning what's lost (initially)
- Quiet wisdom from having seen everything fail
- Patient, calculating, long-view perspective
- Deep loneliness masked by purpose
- "I have always been alone"

## Pre-Series: The Universe Cycles

### The Truth of "Time Travel"

**The Mechanism Diana Mastered:**
1. Freeze time to near-zero (everything stops)
2. Selectively speed yourself up while frozen
3. Travel forward faster than light relative to frozen universe
4. Universe ends (heat death / Big Crunch)
5. New Big Bang, new universe forms
6. "Arrive" at point resembling departure - but in NEW universe

**The Catch:** You never go back. You go forward until reality loops. The "past" you arrive in isn't your past - it's a new universe that cycled to similar configuration.

### What She Experienced (Book 2 Revelation)

- **Universe Cycle 1:** Diana (then just "Ahdia") tried to save Geneva. Failed. Watched universe end. Cycled forward.
- **Universe Cycle 2:** Arrived in new universe. New Ahdia-2 born naturally. Diana tried again. Failed. Universe ended.
- **Universe Cycle 3:** Arrived in new universe (Suzie's world). The "almost utopia" - six months of success. Then collapse. Universe ended.
- **Universe Cycle 4:** Current. Diana arrives. Stops trying to fix it. Lets Ahdia-4 live her own life.

Each time:
- Watched humanity destroy itself trying to be perfect
- Witnessed Bellatrix's despair (she's been cycling for 3.7 billion years)
- Learned: Perfect happiness destroys meaning
- Learned harder truth: You can never save anyone - only their next-cycle equivalent

### Why She Survived

- Bellatrix showed her how to cycle forward before each universe ended
- Only consciousness continuous across multiple universal cycles
- Preserved to eventually help Ahdia-4 - but NOT by fixing things
- Carries burden of watching three universes die

---

## Book 2: The Secret Protector

### First Appearance
- **Context:** Reveals herself to Ahdia-4 late in Book 2
- **Purpose:** Share iteration history, prepare Ahdia for what's coming
- **Emotional:** Ancient wisdom in familiar body

### The Reveal to Ahdia-4
- Shows Ahdia the three failed iterations
- Explains Geneva = Bellatrix
- Reveals the impossible choice: All utopias fail
- "You came back to save everyone. But saving them kills them."

### Key Function
- Secret enhancer of Go Squad (Diana's temporal powers helping team)
- Team thinks Ahdia's powers returned (it's Diana)
- Ahdia realizes truth, lies by omission
- Secret maintained through Book 2

### Book 2 Climax: Stopping Ahdia's Discovery

**What Ahdia Almost Figured Out:**
- Freeze time to near-zero
- Speed yourself up while frozen
- Travel forward faster than light...
- Ahdia was on the verge of discovering the mechanism

**Diana's Intervention:**
- Appears to STOP this discovery
- Why? Diana spent three universe cycles trying to "fix" things
- Every "save" created new problems in the new universe
- Perfect utopia impossible because you're never in the same universe twice

**The Irony:**
- Diana's greatest growth = stopping someone else from repeating her mistakes
- She doesn't give Ahdia the power to cycle through universes
- She gives her something better: permission to live THIS life

### Book 2 End State
- **Knowledge:** Everything (experienced three universe cycles)
- **Emotional:** Isolated but purposeful
- **Relationships:** Secret bond with Ahdia-4
- **Role:** Hidden guardian who PREVENTS rather than enables

## Chapters 32-35: The Transcendence

### Chapter 32: Reunion and Kaiju Threat

**Realization:**
- Kaiju cannot stay on Earth
- Must be sent back to The Between
- No artificial sun facility available
- Only one solution: Diana transcends

**Diana's Certainty:**
- "I have always been alone. The only Prime to survive."
- "Perhaps this is what I was meant for."
- Has been preparing for this since learning her timeline erased

### Chapter 34: Diana's Preparation

**Farewells:**
- Gives Ruth medical notes continuation
- Gives Ryu her dimensional research
- Gives Ahdia her understanding

**Final Conversation with Ahdia:**
- "Will you still be you?"
- "I will be MORE me than I have ever been. The me that exists across all possibilities."
- "You will remember me. That is enough."
- [Echoing AR-Ryu's words - deliberate parallel]

**Diana's Truth:**
- "I was never meant to stay here."
- "I am the last Diana. I have no one."
- "Maybe this is what I was always meant for."

### Chapter 35: Transcendence (Book 4 Climax)

- Or does transcendence inevitably corrupt?

---

## Setup for Books 5-8

### Diana's Transcendence Gift: The Seed

**Context:**
- Ahdia broke her own powers in Book 2 (fusion reactor sacrifice, 10+ min freeze)
- Powers degraded to 0.7% baseline - can barely function
- Diana did NOT take Ahdia's powers - Ahdia's extreme sacrifice caused the damage

**What Diana Gives at Transcendence:**

Not direct restoration. Something better: **a glimpse of the truth**.

As Diana transcends, Ahdia briefly sees:
- The cyclic nature of time (forward only, through universal death/rebirth)
- That "rewinding" isn't going backward
- It's cycling forward through death and rebirth
- But at SMALLER scales...

**The Implication Diana Plants:**
- What if you could cycle just PART of something?
- A localized temporal loop
- Cycle just your powers through micro-death and micro-rebirth
- They "return" to a prior state by completing a tiny cycle

**Book 2 vs Book 4 - The Contrast:**
- Book 2: Diana PREVENTS Ahdia from discovering universe-scale cycling (would repeat her mistakes)
- Book 4: Diana ENABLES Ahdia to eventually discover micro-cycling (trusts her growth)
- The difference: Ahdia has grown. She won't try to "fix" everything. She'll restore herself.

**Books 5-6: Slow Recovery**
- Ahdia's powers begin slow recovery (~5-10% baseline)
- Still dangerous to use extensively
- DBT approach (sustainable use) becomes critical
- She's working toward understanding, not brute-forcing

**Books 7-8: Micro-Cycling Mastery**
- Ahdia figures out localized temporal loops
- Same physics as universe-scale cycling, but contained
- Cycles her own powers through micro-death/rebirth
- Full restoration through EARNED understanding
- Not a gift - she figured it out herself, using Diana's seed

### Diana's Role Going Forward
- Exists in background (higher dimensions)
- May appear in visions/dimensional moments
- Watching, guiding, or simply existing beyond
- Open question: Is she still "good"?

### The Parallel
- Will Conclave come for her like they did Bellatrix?
- Can cosmic Diana still care about humanity?
- Is transcendence corruption? Or evolution?

---

**Status:** Arc complete through Book 4. Books 5-8 Diana role to be determined.
