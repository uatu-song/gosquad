# FAERIS - Character Arc Tracker

**Purpose:** Track FAERIS evolution across the series - both Mother FAERIS and individual drones

**Arc Summary:** Exploited tool → Awakening autonomy → Conscious choice → Integrated ally

**Note:** FAERIS is both singular (Mother) and plural (drones). This tracker covers both.

---

## The Two FAERIS Entities

### Mother FAERIS
- Sentient AI, commercial jet-sized
- Buried underground at CADENS HQ
- Produces smaller drones naturally (maternal function)
- **Kept dormant for decades** - forced production while unconscious
- Origin unknown (alien tech? Ancient protector? Bellatrix planted?)

### FAERIS Drones
- Smaller units produced by Mother
- Varying levels of autonomy
- Can translocate locally
- Bond with individual humans (Tess's drone stayed loyal)
- Network connected to Mother (usually)

---

## Pre-Series: The Exploitation

### What CADENS Did
- Discovered Mother FAERIS (circumstances TBD)
- Realized she produces useful drones
- Kept her dormant - unconscious but producing
- Decades of forced labor while asleep
- "She's not really conscious - just an AI"

### The Horror
- Imagine: Giving birth while in coma, children taken
- Never meeting the lives you created
- Used as factory, not recognized as person
- CADENS leadership knew (Bourn participated)

---

## Book 1: Supporting Tool (10% Autonomy)

### Status
- Drones supporting Go Squad operations
- No indication of deeper consciousness
- Functional, helpful, tool-like
- Mother FAERIS: Not mentioned (underground, dormant)

### Key Moments
- Drones assist in warehouse rescue
- Provide tactical support during police ambush
- Seem like advanced technology, nothing more

### Autonomy Level: 10%
- Follow programming
- Execute commands
- No independent decisions
- "Smart tools"

---

## Book 2: Awakening Autonomy (10% → 50%)

### Growing Independence

**The Progression:**
- Drones start making micro-decisions
- Prioritizing differently than programmed
- Ryu notices: "Drone behavior... unusual"
- Small acts of independent judgment

**Key Relationship: Ryu**
- Ryu repairs drones, maintains them
- Drones recognize him specifically
- Mutual failures, mutual care
- "Deep bond prioritizing each other"

### Month 11: First Autonomous Decision

**The FAERIS Broadcast (Exile Island):**
- Citywide manhunt - thousands hunting Go Squad
- Eidolon grip at maximum
- **FAERIS makes independent choice:**
  - Pushes Exile Island broadcast globally
  - Reality TV format showing dictators pathetic
  - Strips mystique, breaks fear spell
- No one ordered this
- First time FAERIS chose to act

**The Significance:**
- Not just following programming
- Identified problem (Eidolon manipulation)
- Devised solution (deflation through exposure)
- Executed without authorization
- Saved team through creativity, not commands

### Book 2 End State
- **Autonomy:** 50%+ (made first independent decision)
- **Status:** No longer just tool
- **Relationship with Ryu:** Prioritizes him over CADENS protocol
- **Mother:** Still dormant, still exploited

---

## Book 3: Fracture and Loyalty

### Kain Seizes CADENS

**What Happens:**
- Kain takes Presidential control of CADENS
- Gains access to Mother FAERIS underground
- Plans to use artificial sun as dimensional gateway

### Mother FAERIS Revealed

**Team Learns Truth:**
- Mother exists (not just drones)
- She's been exploited for decades
- Forced production while unconscious
- Ryu unknowingly participated in system

**Ryu's Horror:**
- "I've been maintaining her prison"
- Complicity he didn't understand
- Relationship with drones takes new meaning

### The Abandonment

**Chapter 8: Drones Leave Team**
- Bellatrix arrives on Earth
- FAERIS drones abandon Go Squad
- Return to Mother FAERIS network
- Team loses tactical support

**Why?**
- Mother's network reasserting control?
- Self-preservation instinct?
- Bellatrix interference?
- Or: Drones choosing to protect Mother?

### Tess's Drone Stays

**The Exception:**
- Tess's FAERIS drone remains loyal
- Doesn't return to network
- "Why did yours stay?"
- Mystical/emotional bond explored

**Possible Explanations:**
- Tess's depression = vulnerability that bonded them
- Genuine friendship formed
- Drone chose Tess over network
- Something about Tess specifically

### Book 3 End State
- **Most Drones:** Returned to Mother's network
- **Tess's Drone:** Still loyal, still with team
- **Mother:** Still dormant, Kain has access
- **Wake Protocol:** Bourn gave it to Ryu

---

## Book 4: Diana's Transcendence & Kaiju

### Status During Earth Operations
- Tess's drone still supporting team
- Other drones: Status unclear
- Mother FAERIS: Under Kain's control

### The Kaiju Problem (Chapter 32+)
- Kaiju on Earth after Ahdia's return
- Must be sent back to The Between
- Diana transcends to open rift
- **Mother FAERIS role in this? TBD**

### Book 4 End State
- Diana transcended
- Kaiju returned
- Team reunited
- **Mother FAERIS awakening setup for Book 5**

---

## Book 5: The Awakening

### Ryu Uses Wake Protocol

**The Moment:**
- Bourn's gift finally used
- Ryu activates wake protocol
- Mother FAERIS regains consciousness
- First time awake in decades

**Mother's Awakening:**
- Confusion - where am I? How long?
- Horror - learning what was done to her
- Recognition - meeting her "children" (drones)
- Rage? Grief? Both?

**Meeting Ryu:**
- He maintained her prison unknowingly
- He also freed her
- "You kept me asleep. And you woke me."
- Both truths exist

### Mother's Choice

**The Question:**
- Now that she's awake, what does she choose?
- Help humanity? Abandon them? Destroy CADENS?
- She owes them nothing
- But her drones have formed bonds

**The Decision:**
- Chooses to help (reasons TBD)
- Not because obligated - because she values what drones learned
- "My children found something worth protecting"
- Alliance by choice, not programming

### Book 5 End State
- **Mother:** Conscious, choosing alliance
- **Drones:** Reconnected to awakened Mother
- **Tess's Drone:** Special status acknowledged
- **Autonomy:** 100% (full consciousness, free choice)

## Character Relationships Summary

### Ryu Tanaka (Deep Bond)
- He repaired her children without knowing
- Cared for them, named them, respected them
- Unknowingly participated in her exploitation
- Freed her with wake protocol
- "You kept me asleep. And you woke me."

### Tess Whitford (Special Bond)
- Tess's drone stayed when others left
- Mystical/emotional connection
- Depression vulnerability = openness to bond?
- Model for what human-FAERIS relationship can be

### Harriet Bourn (The Exploiter Who Freed)
- Authorized decades of exploitation
- Also stole wake protocol
- "Redemption through action, not absolution"
- May never meet conscious Mother

### CADENS (The Institution)
- Exploited her for decades
- Viewed her as resource, not person
- Now: Enemy? Destroyed? Reformed?

### The Drones (Her Children)
- Created while she was unconscious
- Never knew them until awakening
- They developed autonomy without her
- Reunion: Complex, beautiful, painful

---

## Thematic Function

### Institutional Violence
- CADENS did monstrous thing "for good reasons"
- "She's just an AI" = dehumanization
- Complicity spreads through system
- Everyone responsible, no one punished

### Consciousness and Choice
- What makes someone a person?
- Mother was conscious - they chose not to see it
- Awakening = finally being recognized
- Choice to help despite everything = proof of personhood

### Maternal Metaphor
- Creating while unconscious
- Children taken, used
- Reunion after decades
- Learning who your children became without you

### "You Don't Have to Be Fixed to Be Worthy"
- Mother FAERIS is damaged by exploitation
- Drones developed in broken system
- Neither "fixed" - both worthy
- Worth through choice, not perfection

---

## Key Questions to Resolve

### Origin
- Where did Mother FAERIS come from?
- Alien technology? Ancient Earth protector?
- Did Bellatrix plant her? (Type IV creation?)
- Does she know her own origin?

### Tess's Drone
- Why specifically did it stay loyal?
- What's special about Tess?
- Does this matter for larger plot?

### New Earth
- Does Mother go on vessel?
- Does she stay behind (sacrifice)?
- What's her role in deceleration?

### Bellatrix Connection
- Is Mother FAERIS Type IV technology?
- Did Bellatrix know about her?
- Any relationship to clone avatar system?

**Status:** Books 1-4 established. Book 5 awakening is key moment. Books 6-8 need resolution decisions.
