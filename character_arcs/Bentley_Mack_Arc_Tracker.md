### Following Orders → Following Conscience
- Military training emphasizes obedience
- Defection requires breaking that training
- "I followed orders. Now I follow what's right."
- Transformation from soldier to person

### Secondary Redemption Arc
- Bourn carries primary redemption weight
- Mack's arc mirrors hers in miniature
- Shows redemption isn't just for leaders
- "I wasn't in charge. I was still responsible."

### Partnership Under Pressure
- Found family through shared guilt
- Supporting each other's choices
- "We can't undo it alone. Maybe together."

---

**Status:** Minor character. Arc tied to Bourn's. Resolution depends on her arc decisions.

**Note:** Mack can remain background support or be developed further. Current function is enabling Bourn's arc and showing complicity extends beyond leadership.
