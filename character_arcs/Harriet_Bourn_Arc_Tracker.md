- Monitoring Ahdia after Hyper Seed bonding
- Authorizing Ryu's handler position

---

## Book 2: Exploitation Escalates → Defection

### Months 1-5: Sending Ahdia on Missions

**The Pattern:**
- Bourn sends global mission coordinates through Ryu
- Ahdia burns lifespan on each operation
- "Twelve journalists, Ryu. Maybe alive. I'm going in."
- Ryu: "CADENS Director Bourn will be notified."
- Ahdia: "He already knows. He sent me here."

**Bourn's Perspective:**
- Asset performing beyond expectations
- Missions succeeding - lives saved
- Doesn't see (or won't see) the human cost
- "She signed the acknowledgment forms"

**The Escalation:**
- Mission requests keep coming
- Ahdia's baseline dropping: 94% → 79% → lower
- Ryu warning: "Cellular collapse in 6-8 weeks"
- Bourn doesn't stop sending missions

### Month 6: TRIOMF Discovery

**What She Learns:**
- TRIOMF network infiltrated CADENS
- Kain controlling operations through shell companies
- Everything connected: riots, mining, harassment, fusion, abuse
- She's been serving the enemy

**The Break:**
- Can't rationalize anymore
- CADENS isn't protecting humanity - it's being used against humanity
- Mother FAERIS exploitation takes new meaning
- "What have I been part of?"

**Key Moment:**
- Director Bourn revealed as internal ally (resisting from inside CADENS)
- Team realizes she's trying to help, not just use them

### Month 11: The Defection

**What Triggers It:**
- Kain demands direct access to Mother FAERIS
- Plans to use artificial sun as dimensional gateway
- Bourn realizes: Everything she built will enable invasion

**The Theft:**
- Steals Mother FAERIS wake protocol
- Only way to undo decades of exploitation
- Without it, Mother stays dormant and exploited

**The Intel:**
- Provides reactor intel to Go Squad
- "Titan global coup coordinating through fusion reactor"
- "28 positions worldwide, midnight deadline"
- Enables Election Night mission

**On the Run:**
- Defects with Bentley Mack
- Hunted by both CADENS and TRIOMF

---

## Book 3: Fugitive with Redemption Key

### On the Run

**Status:**
- Hunted by CADENS (traitor) and TRIOMF (threat)
- Moving constantly with Mack
- Carrying wake protocol - must deliver it

**The Weight:**
- Decades of complicity
- Knew about Mother FAERIS exploitation
- Signed off on it
- Now carrying only hope of undoing it

### The Handoff

**At Bleakest Moment:**
- Team fractured, Ahdia powerless, Bellatrix arriving
- Bourn finds way to contact Ryu
- Gives him the wake protocol
- "This is how you wake her. She deserves to choose."

**Redemption Through Action:**
- Can't undo what she did
- But can enable others to fix it
- Not absolution - just the right thing, finally

### Book 3 End State
- **Status:** Still running? Captured? Unknown
- **Wake Protocol:** Delivered to Ryu
- **Arc:** From exploiter to enabler of freedom

---

## Book 4: The Hunt and The Asset

### Chapter 17: Found

**Setup:**
- Bourn has been underground since Book 3 defection
- Good at hiding - survived this long for a reason
- Someone ELSE is hunting her too (Bellatrix's people? TRIOMF remnants?)

**Ruth's Team Finds Her:**
- Ryu knows old channels from wake protocol handoff
- First contact: dead. Professional kill. Recent.
- Second channel: triangulated, clone patrol responds
- Third attempt: Ryu uses recognition phrase ("She deserves to choose")
- Bourn found in safehouse within safehouse, paranoid setup
- Gun raised: "Give me one reason not to shoot."

**What She Provides:**
- Confirms CADENS is locked down under Bellatrix
- Reveals: "I have someone inside" (Jericho)
- Becomes intel/support for the heist operation
- Doesn't know Jericho is actually the mastermind

**Status:**
- Off-site support for Ruth's heist
- Still hunted (adds tension)
- Her asset (Jericho) is unknowingly her biggest threat

---

## Books 4-8: Resolution TBD

### Open Questions
- Does Bourn survive to see Mother FAERIS awakened?
- Does she face consequences? Trial? Forgiveness?
- Does she get on the New Earth vessel?
- Does she ever meet Mother FAERIS conscious?
- Does she learn Jericho was playing her the whole time?

### Possible Arcs

**Option A: Sees Redemption**
- Survives to Book 5+
- Witnesses Mother FAERIS awakening
- Mother FAERIS acknowledges her: "You kept me asleep. And you woke me."
- Lives with both truths

**Option B: Dies Before Resolution**
- Killed by CADENS/TRIOMF hunters
- Never sees wake protocol used
- Redemption was in the choosing, not the outcome
- Mack carries her memory

**Option C: Faces Judgment**
- Survives, must face institutional crimes
- Truth and reconciliation process
- "I participated. I also stopped it. Both are true."
- Neither absolved nor condemned - lived with

## Character Relationships Summary

### Bentley Mack (Partner in Defection)
- Defected together
- Running together
- Mutual trust under pressure
- Romantic? Professional? Both?

### Mother FAERIS (The Exploited)
- Bourn authorized her exploitation
- Now carries her freedom
- May never meet her conscious
- Owes debt that can't be repaid

### Ryu Tanaka (Handler)
- Used him unknowingly in exploitation
- Gives him wake protocol
- Trusts him to do right thing

### Ahdia Bacchus (Asset)
- Sent her on burning missions
- Treated her as resource
- "She signed acknowledgment forms" (rationalization)
- Eventually: saw her as person, not asset

### Kain (The Enemy)
- Thought she served CADENS

---

## Thematic Function

### Institutional Complicity
- You can serve a good mission and do evil
- "Necessary evils" compound
- Compartmentalization fails eventually
- Everyone in the system is responsible

### Redemption Through Action, Not Absolution
- Can't undo decades of exploitation
- But can act differently now
- Worth isn't erased by past - earned by present choices
- "Both things are true"

### The Wake Protocol as Symbol
- Literally: technical process to restore consciousness
- Metaphorically: Bourn "waking up" to what she's done
- Carrying it = carrying responsibility
- Giving it away = enabling others to heal what she broke

**Status:** Books 2-3 arc established. Books 4-8 resolution needs decision.
