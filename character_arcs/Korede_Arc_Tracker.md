### Chapter 15: The Crucial Decision

**Location:** Different front - defending civilians from clone avatars

**The Dilemma:**
- Ruth's message: "We need your help to open the rift"
- Signal detected, might be Ahdia alive
- BUT: Civilians in his sector need defending NOW
- Can't be in two places at once

**His Reasoning:**
- "Those people need us HERE. Now. For certain."
- "Ahdia MIGHT be alive. MIGHT need rescue."
- "I can't abandon certain need for possible need."
- "I already lost Leta. I know what abandonment costs."

**Decision (Chapter 15):** Refuses Ruth's request - stays to defend civilians

**Knowledge State:**
- Knows about clone army, signal detected
- Knows Leta's death (carries this weight)
- Doesn't know if signal is really Ahdia or trap
- Practical calculation: Certain lives vs. possible rescue

### Chapter 17: First Wave (TTRPG Rolled)

**Scene 2 Results:**

**What Happens:**

- Every strike lands harder than it needs to
- Victor watching, concerned
- Leah fighting beside him, matching his energy (mirror/warning)

**Outcome:**
- First wave repelled, minimal casualties

### Chapter 19: Eidolon's Assault (TTRPG Rolled)

- Approach: Fighting retreat - give ground strategically

**What Happens:**

- Ben calls tactical retreat through chokepoints
- Crossfire positions tear through black-eyed ranks
- Leah doesn't fall back fast enough—holds position too long
- Korede breaks formation to pull her out, takes wound (not fatal)
- Lost eastern chokepoint. Enemy has foothold.
- Civilians saved, but Korede bleeding, Leah shaken

**Scene 2: Korede and Leah**
- Roll: 12 (Success)
- Approach: Silence

**What Happens:**
- Medic patching Korede. Leah standing nearby.
- No words needed. They recognize each other now.

- Leah: "How do you stop?"
- Korede: "I'll let you know when I figure it out."
- First crack in both their armor—not fixed, but *seen*
- Kinship established (not romance)

**Scene 3: Victor's Concern**
- Roll: 2 (Complication)
- Approach: Uses wound as excuse to talk

**What Happens:**
- Victor pushes too hard: "You've been wanting to break since Leta—"

- Core group around Korede stays intact but shrinking

**Scene 4b: Personal Targeting**
- Roll: 5 (Complication)

**What Eidolon Does:**
- Identifies Korede—the one burning with rage
- Pushes fear directly at him. Three visions:
  1. Leta's death—reliving the moment, every detail
  2. Becoming the monster—his reflection with black eyes
  3. Everyone he fails—civilians, Leah, Ben, Victor dying
- The break: Korede on his knees, screaming, drowning
- Eidolon learns: "So much fear underneath the anger. Delicious."

**Scene 4c: Civilian Terror**
- Roll: 14 (Success)

**What Happens:**
- While Korede's broken, Eidolon hits evacuation routes
- Leah steps up: "He saved me. Now I save them."
- Holds chokepoint ALONE for ninety seconds
- Not rage this time—*focus*. Controlled.
- Ben repositions, Victor redirects flow

Ben's "Death":
- Holds choke point against clone wave
- Last transmission: "Korede, you better make this count. Go get her."
- Then: static
- Korede has to leave, believing Ben just died for him

**The Arrival:**
- Brings forces and equipment to Ruth's coalition
- Carrying Ben's sacrifice—HAS to make it count
- "We're doing this."
- Ruth: "Your position—Ben—"
- Korede: "Ben told me to go. He's holding them. He's—" [can't finish]
- Ruth understands

**Key Moment:**
- Korede to Ruth: "Ben said you needed me more. He better be right."
- Ruth: "He is. And we're going to make sure his sacrifice means something."
- Korede: "It already does. I'm here."
