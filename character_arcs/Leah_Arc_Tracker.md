- **Emotional:** Private processing
- **Action:** Online research into Kain's history
- **Secret:** Not sharing her own harassment experience

---

### Chapters 4-5: Early Investigation (Month 2)

**Chapter 4:**

- Finds other women online discussing Kain

**Chapter 5: Webb Exonerated**

### Chapters 6-7: Leta Harassment / Victor Teaching (Months 3-4)

**The Situation:**

- Korede breaks formation to save her, takes wound
- She almost got him killed

**Scene 2: Korede and Leah**
- Roll: 12 (Success)
- Silence between them says everything
- Korede doesn't lecture—he *understands*
- "How do you stop?" she asks
- "I'll let you know when I figure it out."

## Character Relationships Summary

### Victor Hernandez (Primary - Teacher/Catalyst)
- Calls her out without attacking
- Patient but firm
- Shows her what the work looks like
- Makes her want to be better (not just feel guilty)
- Romantic tension? Or deep respect? (TBD)
- Acknowledges growth when it happens

### Tess Whitford (Most Frustrated)
- Least patient with Leah
- "Too little, too late" attitude
- Protective of Leta, resentful Leah made things about herself
- Slow to trust again

### Leta Owolowo (Boundaries)
- Polite but firm boundaries
- Won't do emotional labor for Leah
- "Thanks for speaking up. It would've been better sooner."
- After Leta's death: Leah carries guilt

### Ruth Carter (Patient Teacher)
- Tries to mediate
- Gently pushes Leah to understand consequences
- But prioritizes Leta's safety over Leah's comfort

### Ben Bukowski (Mirror)
- Initially sympathizes with her position
- By Month 7, evolved past her position

- Shows her evolution is possible

### Ahdia Bacchus (Brief Connection)
- Recognizes avoidance pattern (mirror of Ahdia's freeze response)
- Brief moment: "I know it's scary. Do it scared."

---

## Thematic Function

### "You Don't Have to Be Fixed to Be Worthy"
- Applies to white moderates too
- She's worthy of working alongside them even while still learning
- As long as she keeps doing the work
- Not a success story - a work in progress who stopped running away

### White Moderate Growth (Realistic)
- Not transformed overnight
- Two steps forward, one step back
- Still centers herself sometimes
- Still wants credit for "doing the work"
- But stays anyway

### "Not Taking a Stand IS Taking a Stand"
- Core lesson of her arc
- Inaction is a choice with consequences
- Oppressors benefit from bystanders' silence
- Discomfort is the price of worth

### Connection to Book 2 Themes

**Meaning vs Worth:**
- Wants "worth" through team membership
- But without risk, discomfort, taking stands
- Reality: Worth requires choosing values over comfort

**CBT Failing:**
- Initial approach: "If I stay neutral, everyone will like me"
- Reality: Avoidance caused more harm
- Can't control outcomes by avoiding hard choices

**Eidolon Connection:**
- Fear of becoming a target = amplified by Eidolon
- Silence = fear-driven choice
- Learning: "Is this fear justified or distorted?"
- Channel justified fear into action anyway

---

## The Lesson

**Not taking a stand is taking a stand for the status quo.**

Silence is interpreted as approval by those causing harm. Comfort is not neutral—it's a choice to prioritize your safety over others'. Worth requires choosing values over comfort, even when it's scary.

---

**Status:** Book 2 arc complete (primary arc). Books 3-4 show continued imperfect progress.
