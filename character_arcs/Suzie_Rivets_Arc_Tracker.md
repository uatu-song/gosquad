## Character Foundation

### Basic Info
- **Full Name:** Captain Suzie Rivets
- **Callsign:** Troublemaker
- **Rank:** Captain, Canadian Mech Corps (Universe Cycle 3)
- **Origin:** Universe Cycle 3 Earth (the universe that almost succeeded—6 months of utopia, then ended)
- **Mech:** Pioneer ("Pio"), exploration-class prototype
- **Status:** Sole survivor of a dead universe, stranded in The Between for 3-5 subjective years

### Origin: Universe Cycle 3 (The Truth)

**Not a "Parallel Timeline" - A Previous Universe:**
- Suzie's world wasn't "erased" or in another dimension
- Her universe ENDED - Big Crunch, cosmic death, everything gone
- A new universe (Cycle 4 - current) formed after
- She was thrown into The Between as her universe died
- Pioneer's systems protected her from universal death
- Everyone she knew didn't get "erased" - they experienced cosmic death
- "My universe ended. Everyone I knew died. This universe just happens to have people who look like them."

**The World That Almost Made It:**
- Third universe cycle where Diana (Ahdia-Prime) tried to save Earth
- Geneva Windrow presidency successful
- Utopia building carefully, slowly (6+ months stable)
- Most successful cycle before collapse
- Advanced technology (mechs, planetary defense)
- "We almost made it. We were SO CLOSE."
- Then the universe ended

**Suzie's Role:**
- Canadian Mech Corps elite pilot
- Earned "Troublemaker" callsign for unorthodox tactics
- Kept squadron alive through creative problem-solving
- Piloted Pioneer (exploration-class prototype)

### Korede Owolowo (Close Friendship)

**The Bond:**
- Korede has a predilection for machinery—loves working with tech
- Pio is the most complex machine he's ever seen
- First meeting: "Can I look at the mech?" before "Are you okay?"
- Suzie: "Finally, someone with priorities."

**Why It Works:**

- "Pio's not just a machine to him. He gets it."

- He lost his sister (Leta); she lost her world
- Different grief, mutual understanding

- Korede: "...Yeah. I get that."

### Ben Bukowski (Romance - Books 5+)

**The Connection:**
- Two soldiers recognizing each other instantly
- Shared military background (Marines / Canadian Mech Corps)
- Same language, same shorthand, same directness
- Both carry trauma they process through action
- Dark humor as mutual coping mechanism

**Book 4 (Seeds—Then Loss):**
- Ben sees her emerge from rift with Pioneer
- Immediate combat respect—she brought a mech AND kaiju
- Works together in aftermath chaos
- Brief recognition: "You're military." / "Canadian Mech Corps." / "Marines." / "Ah."
- No words needed—they understand each other
- **Then: Ben "dies" holding the line so Korede can reach Ruth**
- Suzie's reaction: Found someone who understood her, lost him immediately
- Grief compounded—she's already lost everyone once

**Book 5 (Reunion):**
- Ben returns from presumed death
- Suzie's reaction intense—she already mourned him
- "You were dead." / "Apparently not." / "...Good."
- Neither needs to say more
- Relationship accelerates—they almost lost this before it started
- Ben helps with Pio repairs (practical support)
- Late night conversations (both can't sleep)
- Team notices the intensity between them

**Books 6-7 (Development):**
- Unspoken understanding deepens
- Actions speak louder: covering each other in combat, small gestures
- Finally acknowledged—understated, no drama
- "So... this is happening." / "Looks like." / "Okay then."
- Two broken people choosing each other

**Why It Works:**
- Neither needs grand romantic gestures
- Both process through doing, not talking
- Presence is enough
- "I've got your six" = their love language
- Worthy of love without being "fixed" first

## Thematic Function

### Narrative Role
- Rescues Ahdia at lowest point
- Living consequence of Diana's choices
- Iteration mythology personified
- Outsider perspective on team/Earth
- Combat asset (mech pilot)

### Thematic Resonance

**Cost of "Greater Good" Decisions:**
- Diana's time travel saved one Earth by destroying three
- Suzie is living proof of that cost
- Makes the philosophical concrete and personal
- "You can't just erase worlds. People LIVE there."

**Survivor Without Powers:**
- Suzie has no temporal abilities
- Survived through skill, determination, Pio
- Proves worth isn't about powers
- "You don't have to be fixed to be worthy"

**Found Family:**
- Lost everything (world, squadron, family)
- Finds new purpose with Go Squad
- Home isn't a place—it's people
- Choosing to belong despite pain

**"Troublemaker" Irony:**
- Her callsign is Troublemaker
- But Diana is the real troublemaker (broke three worlds)
- Suzie causes problems tactically
- Diana caused problems cosmically
- The nickname becomes pointed commentary

---

## Visual Design

### Suzie
- Early 30s, looks older (hard years)
- Short practical hair (military cut)
- Flight suit with Canadian flag patch
- Tool belt, repair kit always
- Scars from Between survival
- Alert posture, military bearing
- Tired eyes but sharp

### Pioneer
- 45 feet tall, humanoid
- Faded white/red (Canadian colors)
- Battle damage, patches visible
- Weathered from years in Between
- Energy blade visible on back
- Missile pods on shoulders
- "She's been through hell. Still standing."

---

## Dialogue Patterns

### General Style
- Direct, no-nonsense
- Sarcastic when stressed
- Military terminology natural
- Drops formality when comfortable
- Dark humor about survival

### Examples
```
"Just a small kaiju." (understatement humor)

"Morning, Pio. What're we killing today?" (routine)

"I'm a troublemaker, not an idiot." (self-aware)

"We were so close. We really thought we'd done it." (grief)

"I'm not forgiving you. But I understand." (complexity)

"Don't let it be for nothing." (purpose)
```

## Book 4 Specific: The Escape

### Suzie's Role in Convergence

**Before the Rift:**
- Guides Ahdia through The Between
- Provides tactical support
- Plans escape route to where rift will open
- Knows the kaiju patterns, dangers

**During the Escape:**
- Pio fights rearguard against kaiju
- Realizes they won't both make it cleanly
- Makes call to eject Ahdia via harpoon
- "I'll hold them. GO!"

**The Harpoon Ejection:**
- Pio has emergency extraction system
- Fires Ahdia toward rift opening
- Suzie turns to face pursuing kaiju
- Buys time for Ahdia to cross

**Following Through:**
- Suzie doesn't sacrifice herself (subverted expectation)
- Pio blasts through kaiju, follows Ahdia
- But kaiju are RIGHT behind
- All three (Ahdia, Suzie/Pio, kaiju pack) come through

**Unintended Consequence:**
- Kaiju loose on Earth
- But: Kaiju are territorial, attack clone army
- Turns the tide for heroes
- Suzie: "I didn't plan that. But I'll take it."

---

## Status

**Book 3:** Introduced, rescues Ahdia, confronts Diana
**Book 4:** Escape partner, brings kaiju through, arrives on Earth
**Books 5-8:** Team integration, found family, honoring lost world

---

## Open Questions

1. **Pio's repairs** - How extensive? Does Pio's AI recover more personality?
2. **Other iteration survivors** - Does Suzie advocate for searching The Between?
3. **Diana's transcendence** - How does Suzie process losing the woman she couldn't forgive?
4. **Long-term role** - Combat specialist? Between expert? Both?
5. **Ben relationship** - How does the romance affect team dynamics? Do they become a combat partnership?

---

**Core Truth:** Suzie is proof that the "greater good" math has a human cost. She's everything Diana sacrificed made tangible—a person, not a statistic. Her survival and integration into Go Squad represents the possibility of moving forward without forgetting what was lost.
