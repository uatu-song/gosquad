### Book 2 Arc Summary

**The Ethical Erosion:**
- Professional doctor → First boundary crossing → Falsifying records → Systematic enablement → Exposure → Can't go back → Living with guilt

**What He Did:**
- Provided coordinates for Exile Island operations
- Falsified medical records
- Hid decline severity from CADENS and Ruth
- Enabled Ahdia's self-destruction

**Why He Did It:**
- Loves her (never confessed)
- Wanted to help her mission
- "She needs this"
- Rationalized each step

**What He Lost:**
- Professional ethics
- Ruth's trust
- Self-respect
- Any claim to innocence

**Setup for Book 3-4:**
- Jericho mentorship begins (6-8 months)
- Wake protocol received from Bourn
- AR-Ryu continues as tool/companion
- Real-Ryu carries guilt into future books

---

## Book 3: Wake Protocol

### Key Developments
- **Jericho Mentorship:** Jericho joined CADENS after Book 1, mentored Ryu for 6-8 months. Real bond formed. Jericho believed in him, guided him. (This makes Book 5 betrayal devastating)
- **AR-Ryu Use:** Deployed whenever Ahdia uses powers, provides real-time support during frozen time

### Book 3 Critical Event: Wake Protocol

**What Happens:**
- Bourn defects, goes underground
- At bleakest moment, Bourn contacts Ryu
- Gives him the **wake protocol** for Mother FAERIS
- Bourn: "This is how you wake her. She deserves to choose."
- Ryu now carries the key to freeing Mother FAERIS

**What This Means:**
- Ryu has institutional knowledge Bourn trusted him with
- Wake protocol = technical process to restore Mother FAERIS's consciousness
- Without it, she stays dormant and exploited
- He's carrying the solution to the rift problem (needs Mother FAERIS awake to open rift)

## Critical Character Facts

- Has been Ryu the whole time, just in clinical mode for survival
- His feelings for Ahdia are REAL - same feelings Real-Ryu has

- Real-Ryu loves Ahdia, doesn't know what's happening
- AR-Ryu will die when battery depletes during rift crossing
- Ahdia will kiss Real-Ryu expecting he remembers → he doesn't
- Only she carries The Between. Real-Ryu will never know what AR-Ryu experienced.

### Jericho Betrayal (Book 5)
- Ryu trusted Jericho completely (mentor relationship)
- Had gut feeling something was wrong, buried it
- When truth revealed: Jericho controlled Eidolon, made phone calls to Kain, orchestrated everything
- Ryu's devastation: "You were like a son to me" revealed as manipulation
