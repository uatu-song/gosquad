- Team's reaction: Shock, joy, tears
- Suzie's reaction: She mourned him, thought she'd lost someone before she even had him
- Parallel to Jericho reveal: Same "he's alive!" structure, opposite emotional payoff
  - Jericho alive = horror (villain escaped)
  - Ben alive = catharsis (hero survived)

**Processing:**

- Two soldiers recognizing each other
- Then: Ben "dies" before anything can develop

**Book 5 (Reunion):**
- Ben returns from presumed death
- Suzie's reaction intense—she already mourned him
- "You were dead." / "Apparently not." / "...Good."
- Neither needs to say more
- Relationship accelerates—they almost lost this before it started

**Books 6-7 (Development):**
- Unspoken understanding deepens
- Actions speak louder: covering each other in combat, small gestures
- Finally acknowledged—understated, no drama
- "So... this is happening." / "Looks like." / "Okay then."
- Two broken people choosing each other without needing to be fixed first

**Why It Works:**
- Shared military background (same language, same shorthand)
- Both direct, no-nonsense, action-oriented
- Both process through doing, not talking
- Dark humor as coping mechanism
- Neither needs grand gestures—presence is enough
- "I've got your six" = their love language
- Near-loss intensified connection before it even started
