Chapter 24

She was running backward. Or standing still while everything ran backward. She couldn't tell. People walked in reverse down the street, their movements jerky and wrong. Rain fell upward, droplets leaping from puddles back into the sky. She reached for the Seed—the familiar cold pressure in her chest—tried to freeze it, stop it, make it normal. Nothing happened. The world kept rewinding. Faster. A car drove backward past her. A pigeon flew tail-first into a tree. Someone's coffee leaped from the gutter back into their hand. Then: a feeling. Not a voice. Not words. Just a feeling from her chest where the Seed sat. She looked down. Blue light pulsed through her skin, visible beneath her hoodie. Each pulse matched her heartbeat. Each pulse sent the world back another second. The feeling said: Wrong direction. She tried to speak. Couldn't. The rain was too loud, falling upward, hissing as it climbed. The feeling again: You only ever pull. Slow. Stop. Backward. What if you pushed? The world inverted.
She fell. Not down—through. Through layers of frozen moments stacked like photographs. She saw them as she passed: the warehouse explosion, frozen mid-blast. Gloom Girl suspended above the bridge. The police ambush, bullets hanging in air. All of them dissolving as she fell past. The feeling: You can't freeze moments. Only delay them. She landed. A hallway. Long. Doors on both sides. Blue doors on the left. Red doors on the right. She'd always opened the blue ones. Always. One of the blue doors swung open. Inside: Montana. The campground. Herself at eight years old, sitting on a log, watching the trees. Little Ahdia looked up. "You've been stuck here. We all have." Adult Ahdia stepped toward the door. One foot. Then the other. Behind her, a red door opened. She didn't turn. Didn't need to. She could feel it—light, movement, forward momentum. Everything she'd been avoiding. Little Ahdia: "You keep looking back. What if you looked forward instead?" Adult Ahdia stopped. Turned. The red door pulsed. Warm. Alive. "I'm scared," she said. Little Ahdia smiled. "Good. That means you're moving."
Something vast moved through the hallway. She couldn't see it. Couldn't process it. Just felt it pass—watching, witnessing. Massive and patient and old. Like the hallway was too small for it but it moved through anyway because it was curious. It didn't stop. Just passed. Observing. The red door pulsed again. She reached for it. Everything CRACKED. Light flooded through—not blue, not cold—RED, hot, forward, fast. Something incomprehensible touched her mind. Not hostile. Not kind. Just there. Vast and dimensional and curious. She saw herself spread across infinite moments—every choice, every timeline, every possible Ahdia—all of them moving forward, not frozen. All of them reaching for the red door. The thing pulled back. A voice. Cold. Final. NOT the Seed. "Wake up." She jolted awake gasping. White ceiling. Monitors screaming. CADENS medical bay. The IV was torn from her arm. She didn't remember doing that. "Hey, hey—" Ryu's voice, close. "You're okay. You're—" She tried to sit up. The room tilted. "Whoa, easy." His hand on her shoulder. Gentle. "You've been out for three hours."
Three hours. She blinked. Tried to focus. Ryu was standing next to the bed, glasses slightly crooked, looking like he hadn't slept in a week. Which, knowing him, he probably hadn't. "What happened?" Her voice came out scratchy. "You passed out. Ruth said—" He stopped. Adjusted his glasses. "You were in pretty bad shape when they brought you in." "Where's Ruth?" He hesitated. "Where's Ruth?" "She left. With the others." Ahdia's stomach dropped. "Left where?" Ryu didn't answer. Just pointed at the monitor on the wall. She looked up. The screen showed downtown. Smoke. Fire. Buildings with chunks missing. And in the middle of it all— "What the hell is that?" "Kain." Ryu's voice was quiet. "He used the Heart. The Tamois Heart. He's been growing for the past hour." The thing on the screen was twenty feet tall. Maybe more. Still shaped like a person, but wrong. Translucent skin. Too many joints. The Heart pulsing in its chest like a second sun. "Ruth and the team went after him," Ryu said. "About thirty minutes ago." Ahdia stared at the screen. Watched Kain grab a car. Throw it through a storefront. "They don't have powers," she said.
"I know." "They're going to die." Ryu didn't answer. She swung her legs off the bed. The floor was cold against her bare feet. "Ahdia—" "I need the treatment." She stood. Held the bed rail until the room stopped tilting. "Now." "You can't. The treatment isn't stable yet." Ryu moved between her and the door. "Using your powers will—" "Give me the treatment." The door opened. Bourn stepped in, still in tactical gear. Her expression was grim. "You don't understand," she said. "You need eight more doses. Three weeks between each one. That's six months." On the monitor, Kain grabbed another car. The team was still somewhere between here and there. Moving toward him. "I don't have six months," Ahdia said. Ryu adjusted his glasses. "You collapsed at the docks. Cellular degradation. You've been unconscious for eighteen hours." He gestured at the IV port in her arm, residue of blue-white serum still visible. "Ruth developed a treatment. We administered the first dose. You're stabilized, but still severely damaged. Your cells need time to integrate each dose. If you take them too soon—" "We're out of time," Bourn said. The phrase hung there. Out of time.
Ahdia's hand went to her chest. Where the Seed sat. Cold. Heavy. Her expression shifted. She shoved past Ryu to the cabinet across the room. Pulled it open. Grabbed all eight autoinjectors. Lined them up on the bed. Sat down. Closed her eyes. The Seed flared red. Not blue. Red. The monitors screamed. "She's accelerating!" Ryu was at the monitors now, typing frantically. "She's giving herself the three weeks!" Fifteen seconds passed. Ahdia gasped. Opened her eyes. Grabbed the first autoinjector. Pressed it to her arm. Click. Hiss. Eyes closed. Red again. Ryu's face darkened as he watched the readings. "Energy expenditure is exceeding regeneration. It's a net loss." Ahdia opened her eyes. Saw their faces. Grabbed the second autoinjector anyway. Injected. Eyes closed. Red. Ryu was typing frantically. His words finally appeared on the tablet: RATIO = 1:2000 Another line: TOO FAST = CELLS BURN A third: TRY 1:1500 Ahdia opened her eyes. Saw it. "It's not like there's a dial I can turn!" She looked at her hands. "Or a needle gauge to monitor!" Third injection. Eyes closed. Red.
"Even at perfect ratio, she's only getting fifty percent max," Ryu said to Bourn. His voice was tight. "It's a zero-sum problem." Ahdia opened her eyes. The room swam. Fourth injection. Ryu held up his fingers. Started counting. One. Two. Three. Trying to give her a rhythm. Ahdia closed her eyes. But his fingers were glacially slow from her perspective. She couldn't tell if she was matching it or not. Fifth injection. Ryu grabbed a pen from the desk. Started tapping it. Steady. Rhythmic. A metronome beat. Ahdia tried to hear it through the acceleration. Like listening underwater. Distorted. The Seed burned red in her chest. She opened her eyes, gasping. Sixth injection. Eyes closed. The taps were barely audible now. Like hearing them through a wall. Through an ocean. She was losing the ratio. Just holding whatever she could hold. Seventh injection. Ryu was waving the tablet at her. She could barely see it through the red haze. The words: SLOW DOWN She couldn't. Didn't know how. Eighth injection. Her body was screaming. The Seed flickered red-blue-red. Unstable. She let go. Collapsed forward.
Ryu and Bourn caught her. "Did it work?" Her voice was hoarse. Ryu checked the monitors. "First few integrated. Last ones barely worked. Maybe thirty percent total regeneration." On the feeds, the team was making contact with Kain now. "Is that enough?" Bourn asked. "I don't know." Ahdia stood. Hospital gown, barefoot, barely upright. "It has to be." She reached for the Seed. Red. The world blurred. She was gone. The medical bay was empty. Monitors flatlined. Cabinet empty. Ryu and Bourn turned to the feeds. Waiting.

The light came first. A FAERIS drone materialized in the intersection, beam scanning down. Then the pull—that sick wrongness of space folding. Ahdia appeared. Hospital gown flowing around her bare feet. Hair loose. Hands spread wide at her sides. The Seed flared blue.
Kain froze mid-step. Fist raised, twenty-three feet of translucent horror locked in place. His hand—still wrapped around those teenagers—stopped. The kids hung there, suspended, terrified but alive. The Tank cops froze. Edgar with Sable in his grip. Ogden's fist inches from Battlea's face. Philips and Orlansky mid-charge. Everything else kept moving. The civilians saw her appear. Saw the impossible. Saw the kaiju and the enhanced cops suddenly stop like someone hit pause on reality. For three seconds, nobody moved. Then they ran. The Go Squad didn't run. They stood there in the street where they'd been driven back together. Knight helping Battlea to her feet. Sable leaning against the wall. Gloom Girl on her knees, breathing hard. Ruth beside them, throat still raw. Staring at Ahdia. She stood in the radial center of them. Twenty feet away. Hands still spread. The strain visible in every line of her body—shoulders tight, jaw clenched, hospital gown soaked with sweat. The Seed pulsed blue through the thin fabric. "Is that—" Knight started. "Ahdia," Ruth whispered. Her voice barely worked. Ahdia's eyes were closed. Focusing. Holding Kain. Holding the Tanks. Holding the freeze on five massive targets while everything else moved freely around them.
Civilians were fleeing now. The ones who'd come back. The ones who'd fought. Scrambling away from the frozen kaiju, from the impossible sight of a girl in a hospital gown standing in an intersection holding reality still. The Go Squad didn't move. Ahdia opened her eyes. Looked at them. Saw Ruth's throat—bruised, already darkening. Saw Battlea holding her ribs. Saw Sable's arm hanging wrong. Saw Gloom Girl's split lip, Knight's limping stance. Saw her team. Staring at her. At Ahdia. At the girl who shouldn't be standing. Who should still be unconscious in CADENS medical. Who'd appeared in a hospital gown and bare feet and stopped a twenty-three-foot kaiju mid-strike. Who'd saved them. Who'd saved everyone.
