# Rahs Jericho - CADENS Chief Science Officer

**Status:** Active (Books 2-5+)
**Age:** Early 60s
**Role:** CADENS Chief Science Officer
**Specialty:** Radio wave detection and interpretation
**True Nature:** Hidden antagonist (revealed Books 4-5)

---

## Overview

Rahs Jericho appears to be a brilliant but marginalized scientist who found legitimacy at CADENS. In reality, he is an egomaniac sociopath who controls the Eidolon phenomenon while pretending to merely study it. His equipment doesn't detect trans-temporal communication—it triggers and directs emotional manipulation on a mass scale.

## Book 1 Connection - The Warehouse Incident

### The Kidnapping
- **Book 1 Inciting Incident:** Firas Bacchus saw someone being kidnapped while driving
- **That person was Rahs Jericho**
- Firas followed the kidnappers to the cataclysm ore trafficking warehouse
- Firas was shot in the chest trying to help/save Jericho
- This led to Ruth Carter meeting Ahdia Bacchus
- This is the inciting incident for the entire series

### Devastating Dramatic Irony
- Firas died trying to save the person who becomes the main villain
- The person whose kidnapping started everything is orchestrating mass murder through Eidolon
- Firas's heroism led to Ruth joining Go Squad, fighting the very person Firas tried to save
- When revealed (Books 4-5): Ruth and Ahdia will realize Firas died for JERICHO

### Jericho's Involvement with Warehouse
- Was being kidnapped/taken to cataclysm ore trafficking operation
- Implies connection to cataclysm ore from the beginning
- [Details to be determined: Why was he there? Buyer? Researcher? Kidnapped for leverage?]
- His involvement predates CADENS Chief Science Officer role or was concurrent
- Connection between cataclysm ore and Eidolon control: [To be determined]

### Why This Matters
- **For Ruth:** Will learn her boyfriend died saving the villain
- **For Ahdia:** Will learn the warehouse incident that brought Ruth into her life involved Jericho
- **For the Series:** Everything started because of Jericho
- **Thematic:** Heroism can't distinguish between victims worth saving and villains worth destroying

### Questions to Answer
- Why was Jericho being kidnapped?
- What was his connection to the cataclysm ore operation?
- Did he know Firas died saving him?
- Does he remember the warehouse incident?
- Is cataclysm ore connected to Eidolon control technology?

## Academic Background

### Legitimate Career (Public)
- Credentialed scientist with proper equipment and methodology
- Equipment and data collection are reproducible and accepted by mainstream science
- Data is accurate and verifiable
- Career destroyed when mainstream academia rejected his interpretations of the data

### Fringe Interpretations (Public)
- Claims radio wave patterns represent trans-temporal linguistic communication
- Developed proprietary mathematical method to interpret signals as language
- Translations include extinct languages unknown to modern scholarship
- Some translations matched archaeological findings before they were publicly discovered
- Academia dismissed this as coincidence or fraud

### CADENS Recruitment
- Only received institutional legitimacy from CADENS
- Recruited when CADENS realized: His domain (impossible things) aligned with their domain (powered individuals)
- Became Chief Science Officer
- Only institution willing to fund his research

---

## The Eidolon "Discovery"

### Public Methodology
- Uses legitimate radio wave detection equipment (reproducible, accepted)
- Applies proprietary mathematical method to interpret signals
- Claims signals represent trans-temporal communication from entity he named "Eidolon"
- Named based on ancient Greek signal patterns
- Interprets patterns as linguistic structures
- Translates into human languages, including extinct ones
- 87% accuracy rate predicting riots and mass violence events

### Why He Remains Controversial
- **Equipment:** Legitimate (no scientific disputes)
- **Data:** Accurate and reproducible
- **Interpretation:** Fringe (claims about trans-temporal communication dismissed)
- **Method:** Proprietary (cannot be independently verified)
- **Results:** Disturbingly accurate but unexplained

---

## The Hidden Truth

### Actually
- **Not detecting Eidolon—controlling it**
- Equipment doesn't just detect radio waves—it triggers and directs the Eidolon phenomenon
- "Translations" are actually commands to the entity
- Creates riots to study them and prove his control
- 87% prediction rate because he's causing what he predicts
- Uses equipment to amplify fear and anger in target populations
- Treats human casualties as data points (zero empathy)

### Motivation
- **Primary Drive:** Ego and recognition
- Wants recognition as greatest mind in history
- Academia rejected him—obsessed with proving them wrong
- Uses ideology about "guiding humanity's evolution" as cover
- Real drive is narcissistic need to prove superiority
- Zero empathy for casualties (sees people as experimental subjects)
- Will sacrifice any number of lives to validate his theories

### The Performance
- Presents as warm, supportive, helpful mentor
- Professional, collaborative, generous with research
- All calculated manipulation
- Perfect mask maintained constantly
- Offers mentorship to younger scientists (Ryu)
- Shares decades of documentation freely
- Plants subtle flags but remains trusted ally

## Role in Book 2

### Consultation with Ryu
- **Trigger:** Ryu brings Ahdia's anomalous baseline data (treatment degradation pattern)
- **Context:** Ryu searching for explanation of accelerated cellular breakdown
- **Jericho's Response:** Explains Eidolon through his research documentation
- Shares decades of radio wave pattern analysis
- Connects Eidolon activity to increased temporal stress on powered individuals
- Offers continued mentorship to Ryu
- Provides "predictions" of upcoming riot activity

### Result
- Team learns about Eidolon through Jericho's research
- Begin relying on his predictions for tactical planning
- Jericho controls information flow about the phenomenon
- Creates institutional dependency on his expertise
- Positions himself as indispensable ally
- Plants seeds for later manipulation

### What Team Believes (Book 2)
- Eidolon is external supernatural phenomenon
- Jericho is studying it legitimately
- His predictions help them save lives
- He's a trusted CADENS ally
- His research is their best source of information

### What Reader Suspects (Books 2-3)
- Something is off about the 87% accuracy
- Jericho's explanations are almost too convenient
- Subtle flags suggest he knows more than he shares

### What's Revealed (Books 4-5)
- Jericho is controlling Eidolon, not detecting it
- Equipment triggers/directs the phenomenon
- He's been orchestrating mass violence for research
- Titan Strategic conspiracy is connected to his work
- All manipulation from the beginning

- Books 2-3: Trusted ally, reader suspicion builds
- Book 4: Reveal as controller of Eidolon
- Book 5: Full accounting of casualties and confrontation

### Flags to Plant (Books 2-3)
- 87% accuracy too precise for passive detection
- Convenient timing of predictions
- Subtle control language in explanations
- Equipment descriptions slightly off
- Reactions to casualties (too clinical, data-focused)
- Interest in Ahdia beyond professional concern

---

## Notes for Writers

### When Writing Jericho (Books 2-3)
- Maintain warm professorial tone
- Never let mask slip
- Make reader like him (makes reveal more impactful)
- Plant subtle flags reader can only see on reread
- Use academic persecution narrative as deflection
- Turn every question into teaching opportunity

### The Reveal (Books 4-5)
- Recontextualize all previous appearances
- Show recordings of him activating equipment during "predicted" events
- Expose ideological justifications as narcissism
- No redemption arc (he's a sociopath)
- Full accounting of casualties he caused

### Thematic Function
- Science without ethics
- Institutional cover for evil
- Manipulation through expertise
- Hidden villains vs. overt ones (Kain is loud, Jericho is quiet)

---

**CRITICAL REMINDER:** Jericho is the hidden antagonist. All appearances in Books 2-3 must maintain perfect mask while planting subtle flags for later reveal. He is NOT a sympathetic character—he's a manipulative sociopath using scientific credibility to commit mass violence for ego gratification.
