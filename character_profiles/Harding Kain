You act.

Caledonia is burning.

Crime in the streets.
Chaos in our institutions.
Disrespect for law and order.

I will be the firefighter.
I will restore order.
I will make you safe again.

And yes, some will complain.
They always do.

But when your children sleep safe in their beds?
When you walk the streets without fear?

You'll thank me.

(Crowd: "KAIN! KAIN! KAIN!")
```

**Private Meeting:**
```
WHITFORD: The Go Squad is becoming a problem.

KAIN: Quantify.

WHITFORD: They've exposed three clones this month.

KAIN: The media reports what we tell them.

WHITFORD: Some outlets are—

KAIN: Will be purchased or destroyed.

WHITFORD: And the Bacchus girl?

WHITFORD: She can detect replacements.

KAIN: Then she becomes priority alpha.
Eliminate or recruit.
Your choice.

But solve it.
```

**Villain Reveal:**
```
AHDIA: Why? Why do all this?

KAIN: Have you looked at the world lately?

AHDIA: It's not perfect—

KAIN: It's chaos. Entropy. Decay.

Different people wanting different things.
Conflict is inevitable.

Unless everyone wants the same thing.

AHDIA: That's tyranny.

KAIN: That's harmony.

A billion voices screaming different demands?
That's democracy.
Loud. Inefficient. Weak.

One vision. One purpose. One will.
That's power.
That's order.
That's peace.

AHDIA: That's death.

KAIN: Only for those who can't adapt.
Evolution, Ms. Auerbach.
I'm simply... accelerating it.

AHDIA: You're insane.

KAIN: I'm the only sane person in the asylum.

And soon, everyone will see it my way.

Because they'll be me.
```

**If Clone Questioning Programming:**
```
KAIN: (alone, looking in mirror)
I am Harding Kain.

(pause)

Am I?

I have his memories.
His face.
His ambitions.

But his wife looks at me
and I see it in her eyes.

She knows.

She knows I'm not him.

(touches face)

What am I?

A copy of a dead man?
A weapon with delusions of personhood?

(hardens)

No.

I am Harding Kain.
Better than the original.

I will not doubt.
I will not question.

I am the mission.

(but doubt remains)
```

**To Ahdia (Trying Recruitment):**
```
KAIN: You could work with me, you know.

AHDIA: Never.

KAIN: Your power. My vision.
We could remake the world perfectly.

AHDIA: Your "perfect" is my nightmare.

KAIN: Is it? Look around.
People suffering.
Systems failing.
Endless conflict.

You have the power to fix it.
Stop time. Freeze the chaos.
Let me build order in the stillness.

AHDIA: By erasing everyone who disagrees?

KAIN: By upgrading them.
You grief for unchosen timelines, yes?

Imagine if everyone could choose
to be better.

To be their best selves.

AHDIA: You don't offer choice.

KAIN: The weak need guidance.

AHDIA: You're not a guide. You're a cancer.

KAIN: (cold) Then you're a tumor
I'll have to excise.

Pity. We could have been magnificent.

## Quote Collection

**On Order:**
> "People say they want freedom. But what they really want is safety. Security. The certainty that tomorrow will be like today. I give them that. I give them peace."

**On the Clone Program:**
> "Every clone is an upgrade. We keep the useful parts—the knowledge, the relationships, the position—and remove the weakness. The doubt. The disloyalty. It's not murder. It's evolution."

**On Opposition:**
> "They call me a fascist. A tyrant. As if those words mean anything anymore. I'm a pragmatist. I see a problem. I solve it. If that makes me a villain in their eyes, so be it. History will vindicate me."

**On Ahdia:**
> "The Bacchus girl thinks she's a hero because she's powerful. But power without vision is just chaos. I'll give her a choice: Use that power for something greater, or watch me build my better world over her corpse."

**If Clone Questioning:**
> "Sometimes I wonder if the real Harding Kain would have gone this far. Then I remember: I *am* Harding Kain. The doubts are just programming errors. Ghosts of the original's weakness. I will not inherit his failures."

**Final Confrontation:**
> "You've won nothing. Even if you stop me, do you think I'm the only one? We're everywhere now. In every precinct, every courthouse, every boardroom. The transformation has already begun. You can't stop an idea whose time has come."

**On Humanity:**
> "Humanity is a rough draft. I'm simply providing the edits."
