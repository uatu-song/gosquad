FIRAS: You know what your father is doing.

TESS: That's not fair—

FIRAS: You've been sending us intel anonymously.
Encrypted files. Police schedules. Raid plans.

TESS: ...How did you know it was me?

FIRAS: Because you're the only one with
access AND conscience.

TESS: If he finds out—

FIRAS: Join us. Fight back properly.

TESS: He's still my father.

FIRAS: I know. I'm sorry.
But he's also hurting people.

And you can stop him.

TESS: (quietly) Can I?

FIRAS: You already are.
Might as well do it with backup.

## Quote Collection

**On Father:**
> "I keep looking for the dad I remember. But maybe he was never there. Maybe I just couldn't see who he really was."

**On Skills:**
> "You want to know my superpower? I can make your entire digital life disappear. Every file, every email, every photo. Gone. That's power. That's real."

**Post-Reveal:**
> "I thought I was the hacker who couldn't be caught. Turns out I was just fast because someone literally gave me more time. Still not sure if that makes me feel better or worse."

**On Justice:**
> "My father taught me about justice. Then he showed me what happens when justice becomes an excuse for violence. I'm fighting for the version he taught me, against the version he became."

**To Father (Final Confrontation):**
