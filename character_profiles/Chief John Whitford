TESS: It's April. My birthday is April 12th.
You used to take me to the aquarium every year.

You don't remember, do you?

WHITFORD: I remember—

TESS: You remember the file.
The data they uploaded.

But you don't remember ME.

WHITFORD: (at dinner with Tess)
How was school?

TESS: Fine.

WHITFORD: Just fine?

TESS: Yeah, Dad. Just fine.

WHITFORD: (sighs) You used to tell me everything.

TESS: I used to be ten.

WHITFORD: I'm still your father.

TESS: I know.

WHITFORD: Then talk to me.

TESS: (looking at him) About what?

About how you're never home?
About how Mom left because of your job?
About how the cops who report to you
are beating people in the streets?

WHITFORD: That's not—

TESS: (stands) I have homework.

WHITFORD: (alone) When did I lose her?
```

**Public Authority:**
```
WHITFORD: (press conference)
The so-called "Go Squad" are not heroes.

They are vigilantes. Criminals.
Operating outside the law.

We will apprehend them.
We will prosecute them.

And we will restore order to this city.

No more questions.
```

**To Subordinates:**
```
CAPTAIN: Sir, the Bacchus kid is asking
about the Hamilton case—

WHITFORD: Shut it down.

CAPTAIN: He's got community support—

WHITFORD: I don't care if he has God's support.
Make it go away.

CAPTAIN: How?

WHITFORD: I don't care how.
Frame him. Arrest him. Eliminate the problem.

CAPTAIN: ...Yes, sir.

WHITFORD: And Captain?
Do it quietly.
```

**Confronting Tess:**
```
WHITFORD: You've been hacking police systems.

TESS: Prove it.

WHITFORD: I don't need to prove it.
I know it was you.

TESS: Then arrest me.

WHITFORD: Don't tempt me.

TESS: You won't. Because I'm your daughter.

WHITFORD: You're using that as a shield.

TESS: You're using your badge as one.

WHITFORD: (frustrated) Why are you doing this?

TESS: Because someone has to.

WHITFORD: I'm trying to protect you!

TESS: From what? The truth?

WHITFORD: From yourself!

TESS: Or from you?

WHITFORD: ...Get out.

TESS: Gladly.

WHITFORD: (after she leaves)
I'm losing her.

(pause)

Maybe I already lost her.
```

**If Clone Glitching:**
```
WHITFORD: (holding photo of Tess as child)
I remember... I remember...

(programming conflicts with memory)

Taking her to the park.
No.
Target is high-value suspect.

Her birthday.
Eliminate resistance.

She laughed when I...
When I...

(grips head)

ERROR. MEMORY INTEGRATION FAILURE.

(original personality surfaces briefly)

Tess. My little girl.
What have they done to me?

(programming reasserts)

SUBJECT WHITFORD EXPERIENCING INSTABILITY.
INITIATING CORRECTIVE PROTOCOLS.

(struggles)

No. I'm John. I'm her father. I'm...

I'm not...

Who am I?
```

**Final Confrontation (If Original):**
```
TESS: (gun pointed at him)
You killed Firas.

WHITFORD: I gave the order.

TESS: He was my friend!

WHITFORD: He was a threat!

TESS: He was MY BROTHER!

WHITFORD: (pause) I didn't know that mattered to you.

TESS: Of course it mattered!

WHITFORD: You never said—

TESS: I shouldn't have to!

WHITFORD: (quieter) No. You shouldn't.

TESS: So why? Why do all this?

WHITFORD: Because the city was falling apart.
Crime. Chaos. Disorder.

Someone had to restore control.

TESS: By becoming a monster?

WHITFORD: By being willing to do
what others won't.

TESS: And was it worth it?

Was power worth losing Mom?
Worth losing me?

WHITFORD: (long pause) I told myself it was.

TESS: And now?

WHITFORD: (looking at her, gun, distance between them)
Now I'm not sure I believe myself.

TESS: (crying) I wanted you to be a hero.

WHITFORD: I know, kiddo.

(uses old nickname)

I wanted that too.
```

**Redemptive Sacrifice (If Clone Breaks Programming):**
```
WHITFORD: (helping Tess escape)
Go. Now.

TESS: Come with me!

WHITFORD: I can't.
Programming will reassert.

I'll become the enemy again.

TESS: Then we'll deprogram you—

WHITFORD: There's no time.

Listen to me.

I'm not your father.

But I have his memories.

And those memories...
they love you.

TESS: (sobbing) Don't do this.

WHITFORD: Your real father...
he'd be proud of you.

Fighting for what's right.
Even against him.

TESS: I don't want him to be proud.
I want him to be HERE.

WHITFORD: (fading) He is.
Part of him.
In you.

Tell the others... TRIOMF base is...

(gives location, then)

Tess. I'm sorry.

For what they made me.

For what I... what he... what we...

(confused about identity, then clarity)

For failing you.

TESS: You didn't—

WHITFORD: (as facility explodes)
I did.

But maybe this makes up for it.

Run!

(sacrifices self, saves her and team)
```
