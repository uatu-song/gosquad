HOWITZER: Slowed me plenty.
Just didn't stop me.

There's a difference.

BEN: You could've retired.

This job... it's what I am.

BEN: I understand that.

HOWITZER: Yeah. I figured you would.

That's why you're still here too.

BEN: Maybe.

HOWITZER: Definitely.

We're not built for peace, son.

Best we can do is build it for others.
```

**Tactical Advice to Go Squad:**
```
HOWITZER: Your formation is sloppy.

RUTH: We're not military—

HOWITZER: No excuse for getting killed.

Victor, you're hanging back too far.

Leah, you're pushing forward alone.

You're a team. Act like it.

LEAH: We do—

HOWITZER: You act like individuals
who happen to be in same place.

Cover each other. Support each other.

One person isolated is one person dead.

Now run it again.

[They do, it's better]

I remember their names.

HOWITZER: All of them.

That's the job. You lead people into danger.

Some don't come back.

You carry them anyway.

HOWITZER: God, I hope not.

Day it gets easy is the day I quit.
