That's a hero.

I do it myself.

Thank you. Seriously.

you've made extraordinary claims

KAIN: This is desperate—

GENEVA: Harding Kain is running a criminal
organization that is systematically—

KAIN: This is slander—

GENEVA: That has murdered and replaced
public officials with compliant copies.

KAIN: (to moderator) Are you allowing this?

GENEVA: Am I lying? Sue me.
Discovery would be fascinating.

KAIN: You're unhinged—

GENEVA: I have evidence. Documents. Witnesses.

KAIN: Conspiracy theories—

GENEVA: Then debate me on policy.
Healthcare. Climate. Labor rights.

Oh wait, you can't.
Because your actual positions
are deeply unpopular.

So you have to discredit me instead.

(Turns to camera)

He wants you scared.
I want you empowered.

He wants you divided.
I want you united.

He wants you obedient.
I want you free.

The choice is clear.

MODERATOR: Mr. Kain, response?

The Congresswoman is passionate.
I respect that.

But passion without experience is dangerous.

is tyranny.

### Example Dialogue

**Campaign Speech:**
```
GENEVA: They say I'm too young.
Too inexperienced.
Too radical.

You know what I say?

I'm young enough to live with
the consequences of climate change
they're ignoring.

I'm experienced enough—
I worked three jobs to pay for college.
I organized my community.
I know what struggle looks like.

And radical?

Radical is saying healthcare is a human right?
Radical is saying no one should work 40 hours
and still be poor?

Radical is saying police shouldn't
murder people in the streets?

If that's radical, then yeah.
I'm radical.

Because the status quo is killing us.

And I refuse to accept that.

Don't you?

(Crowd: YES!)

Then let's get to work.
```

**Interview (Handling Gotcha Question):**
```
REPORTER: How will you pay for your programs?

GENEVA: How did we pay for
tax cuts for billionaires?

How did we pay for wars that went nowhere?

How do we pay for corporate subsidies?

Somehow money appears for those.

But when it's healthcare for children?
Education? Infrastructure?

Suddenly we're broke?

I don't buy it.

We're the richest country in history.
We have the money.

The question is:
Who do we spend it on?

Billionaires? Or you?

I choose you.
```

**Private Moment (Exhausted):**
```
AIDE: You should rest.

GENEVA: Can't. Three events today.

AIDE: You're running yourself ragged.

GENEVA: I know.

AIDE: It's not sustainable.

GENEVA: (sighs) I know that too.

But what choice do I have?

Kain is literally replacing people.
Building a fascist state.

And I'm supposed to take a nap?

AIDE: You're no good to anyone burned out.

GENEVA: I'm no good to anyone
if I lose either.

AIDE: The movement is bigger than you.

GENEVA: I know.
That's the only thing keeping me going.

(pause)

Okay. One hour rest.
Then back to it.

AIDE: Deal.

GENEVA: Thank you.
For being honest with me.

AIDE: Someone has to be.

GENEVA: I know.
That's why you're here.
```

**With Ahdia:**
```
AHDIA: How do you do it?

GENEVA: Do what?

AHDIA: Keep hoping. When everything's terrible.

GENEVA: Hope isn't about things being good.

Hope is deciding to fight
even when things are bad.

AHDIA: That sounds exhausting.

GENEVA: It is.

But what's the alternative?
Give up?

Let them win?

AHDIA: Sometimes I want to.

GENEVA: Me too.

Every day, honestly.

AHDIA: But you don't.

GENEVA: No.

Because they want us to give up.

That's their strategy.

Make us so tired, so scared,
that we stop fighting.

So I refuse to give them that satisfaction.

AHDIA: Spite as motivation?

GENEVA: Whatever works.

(Both laugh)

GENEVA: Also, I have people counting on me.

Like you.

You fight your way.
I fight mine.

But we're fighting together.

That helps.

AHDIA: Yeah. It does.
```

**Confronting Kain:**
```
KAIN: You're in over your head, Congresswoman.

GENEVA: I don't think so.

KAIN: You're playing a game
you don't understand.

GENEVA: This isn't a game.
These are people's lives.

KAIN: Exactly. Lives I'm saving.

GENEVA: By replacing them with slaves?

KAIN: By upgrading them.

GENEVA: You don't get to decide
who deserves to exist.

KAIN: Someone has to.

GENEVA: No. They don't.

People have the right to self-determination.

To be who they are.

Even if you don't like it.

KAIN: Chaos.

GENEVA: Freedom.

KAIN: You'll lose.

GENEVA: Maybe.

But at least I'll lose as myself.

Not as some sanitized copy
designed to serve power.

Can you say the same?

KAIN: (pause) This conversation is over.

GENEVA: No. It's just beginning.

And this time?

The people are listening.
```

**Victory Speech (If She Wins):**
```
GENEVA: (to enormous crowd)
We did it.

Not me.

WE did it.

They said it was impossible.

They said we were too young.
Too naive.
Too radical.

They said people wouldn't turn out.

(Gestures to crowd)

You proved them wrong.

This victory isn't mine.
It's ours.

It belongs to every volunteer
who knocked doors.

Every donor who gave $5.

Every organizer who registered voters.

Every person who refused to give up hope.

This is your victory.

And now?

The real work begins.

Because winning an election?
That's the easy part.

Building the world we deserve?
That takes all of us.

Every day.

Fighting together.

So let's get to work.

Not me.

Us.

(Crowd: "US! US! US!")
```
