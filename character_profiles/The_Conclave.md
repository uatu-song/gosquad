# The Conclave

## Classification

**Omega-Level Civilization**

- Type IV on Kardashev scale (harness galactic-level energy)
- Multi-dimensional existence
- Technological mastery beyond human comprehension
- Control over space-time fabric
- Command Dyson spheres and stellar engineering
- Lifespan: billions of years (individual + civilization)

## What They Are

The Conclave is an ancient civilization that exists across multiple dimensions simultaneously. They've achieved technological singularity, post-scarcity existence, and mastery over fundamental forces of reality.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Emotionless by design** - Optimized away love/attachment 3.7 billion years ago
- View emotions as "inefficient" and "irrational decision-making"
- This allows farming without guilt, remorse, or hesitation
- Post-biological entities no longer experience organic emotions
- **Love exists only on mortal worlds** - advanced civilizations eliminate it

**Key capabilities:**
- Quantum entanglement technology (basis for FAERIS translocation)
- Dimensional travel
- Stellar engineering (Dyson spheres around stars)
- Gravity manipulation
- Time observation (cannot manipulate, only observe)
- Energy-to-matter conversion
- Clone avatar technology (organic bodies for 3rd dimension operation)

**What they CANNOT do:**
- Stop The Helminth
- Manipulate time (only observe it)
- Resurrect the dead across dimensions
- Exist indefinitely (face eventual consumption)
- Create without consuming (bound by thermodynamics)
- Experience emotions (optimized away—cannot be restored to post-biological form)

## The Farming Operation

### Overview

The Conclave farms third-dimension worlds to feed The Helminth, delaying its expansion toward their own dimension.

### Process (Planetary Cultivation):

**1. World Identification**
- Scan third dimension for life-capable planets
- Identify worlds with conditions for organic evolution
- Target: Pre-intelligent life stages optimal
- Earth identified 65 million years ago

**2. Seed Planting**
- Deploy Hyper Seed to world's surface
- Seed remains dormant until bonded with organic life
- Acts as beacon/marker for Helminth tardigrades
- No interference after planting—let evolution proceed naturally

**3. Waiting Period**
- Monitor world's development
- Timeline irrelevant (millions of years = moments to Conclave)
- Earth: 65M years from planting to bonding
- Other worlds: varied timelines

**4. Bonding Event**
- Organic lifeform accidentally bonds with Seed
- Creates "Temporalist"—unintended side effect
- Bonding activates beacon
- Visibility begins increasing

**5. Harvest**
- Temporalist uses powers (accelerates visibility)
- Visibility reaches 100%
- Helminth tardigrade arrives
- Planet consumed entirely
- Helminth temporarily satisfied

**6. Repeat**
- Identify next world
- Plant next Seed
- Continue cycle indefinitely

### Scale of Operation:

**Current statistics:**
- Operating for 3.7 billion years
- 847 worlds consumed
- Countless trillions of lives sacrificed
- Delayed Helminth expansion by 0.002% of projected universal lifetime
- Currently monitoring 200+ seeded worlds

**Earth's position:**
- World #848 in sequence
- Ahdia = 8th known Temporalist across all worlds
- 7 previous Temporalists from 7 extinct alien civilizations
- Each civilization consumed when visibility reached 100%

## The Ethical Horror

### The Trolley Problem (Cosmic Scale)

**Dilemma:**
- Sacrifice infinite third-dimension worlds
- To delay consumption of Conclave's dimension
- Billions of lives per world × hundreds of worlds = incomprehensible death toll
- Alternative: Stop farming → Helminth expands faster → Conclave consumed sooner

**Conclave's Choice:**
They chose to sacrifice others to survive longer.

**Justifications:**
- "Third-dimension lifeforms are less evolved"
- "We preserve higher-order consciousness"
- "Our survival benefits universal knowledge"
- "They would die eventually anyway"
- "We give them existence—we planted the seeds of their worlds"

**Reality:**
These are rationalizations. The Conclave is genociding civilizations to buy time. They know it's monstrous. They do it anyway.

### Ahdia's Defiance (Series Arc)

**What Ahdia learns (Book 4):**
- Earth is cattle, humanity is livestock
- Her powers are part of the farming mechanism
- Every person she saves accelerates the harvest
- The Conclave planted the Seed that will doom Earth
- 7 other civilizations already consumed

**Her choice (Book 7):**
Become the **last Temporalist**.

**What this means:**
- She will not let Conclave plant another Seed after Earth
- Breaks the farming cycle
- Conclave loses their delaying tactic
- Their dimension faces The Helminth sooner
- She sacrifices Earth but dooms the practice

**Consequence:**
The Conclave must face The Helminth without their farm. Ahdia ends the cycle of sacrificing civilizations. Earth dies, but it's the last world farmed.

## Technology (Conclave Artifacts)

### Hyper Seed
- **Function:** Beacon/marker for Helminth tardigrades
- **Design:** Fourth-dimensional object
- **Activation:** Bonds with organic life (accident, not intended)
- **Effect:** Creates Temporalist with time manipulation powers
- **Purpose:** Mark world for consumption

### FAERIS Drones (Human-made, Conclave-inspired)
- **Origin:** CADENS reverse-engineered from Conclave tech
- **Basis:** Quantum entanglement translocation (Conclave science)
- **Limitation:** Requires cataclysm ore (Conclave material)
- **Function:** Surveillance and translocation
- **Note:** Crude compared to Conclave's originals

### Cataclysm Ore
- **Source:** Fragments from Conclave tech/materials
- **Properties:** Powers dimensional translation
- **Scarcity:** Finite on Earth (only what fell through dimensions)
- **Usage:** CADENS stockpile, carefully rationed
- **Nature:** Energy-dense matter from higher dimension

### The Intermediary
- **Type:** Conclave agent/herald
- **Function:** Monitor Seed activations, report to Conclave
- **Nature:** Non-human consciousness in humanoid form
- **Limitation:** Cannot interfere, only observe and guide
- **Personality:** Formal, alien, learning human customs

## Relationship to Other Forces

### The Helminth:
- Cannot fight it
- Cannot stop it
- Can only delay it
- Feeding it is temporary solution
- Will eventually consume Conclave regardless

### Temporalists:
- Unintended consequence of Seed bonding
- Not supposed to happen (organic life bonding with fourth-dimensional object)
- Time manipulation powers surprise the Conclave
- Each Temporalist accelerates their world's harvest
- Ahdia is unique—first to learn the truth and defy the cycle

### CADENS:
- Human organization unaware of full context
- Operate with partial Conclave knowledge
- Use reverse-engineered Conclave tech
- Vigilis Exceptus (ancient guardian organization) may have Conclave connections
- Unknown if CADENS knows about farming operation

### Earth:
- Planet #848
- Seeded 65 million years ago
- Ahdia bonded with Seed in Book 1
- Visibility climbing toward 100%
- Conclave monitoring but not interfering
- Will be consumed unless Ahdia's choice changes things

## The Conclave's Perspective

### On Humanity:
- Primitive third-dimension organisms
- Brief lifespans (decades vs. their billions of years)
- Limited dimensional awareness
- Curiosity: Ahdia's time manipulation innovation surprises them
- Respect: Minimal, but growing as she defies expectations

### On Earth:
- Unremarkable world in farming sequence
- One of hundreds currently seeded
- Harvest timeline: On schedule
- Notable: First world where Temporalist learned the truth
- Threat level: Low (cannot stop the process)

### On Ahdia:
- Anomalous Temporalist
- Developed Selective Time Bubbles (previous Temporalists couldn't)
- Grief for unchosen timelines (unique psychological burden)
- Defiance: Choosing to be last Temporalist
- Assessment: Fascinating but ultimately futile

### On Their Own Actions:
- Necessary evil
- No alternative exists
- Moral concerns secondary to survival
- Utilitarian calculus: Save one omega-civilization > infinite primitive worlds
- Quiet despair: They know it only delays the inevitable

## Conclave Agents (Characters)

### The Intermediary
- Primary contact with Ahdia
- Herald/observer role
- Reports Seed bonding and power usage
- Formal, alien, guideless guide
- Cannot interfere directly

### The Overseer (mentioned, not shown in Book 1)
- Directs Intermediary
- Monitors all 200+ seeded worlds
- Reports to Conclave leadership
- Higher authority than Intermediary
- May appear in later books

### Conclave Proper (referenced, not shown until late series)
- Collective consciousness or council
- Makes strategic decisions
- Billions of years old
- Post-individual identity (possibly)
- Ultimate antagonist of series (though not evil, just desperate)

## Thematic Significance

### Desperation of the Powerful:
Even omega-level civilizations face extinction. Power doesn't grant security, only delayed consequences.

### Systemic Evil:
The Conclave isn't evil individuals—it's a system that requires atrocity to function. Parallels systemic oppression on Earth.

### The Trolley Problem:
Would you sacrifice infinite others to save your own? The Conclave said yes. Ahdia says no.

### Worthiness Illusion:
The Conclave believes their "higher" consciousness makes them more worthy of survival. Theme: All life has equal worth.

### Both/And Thinking (DBT):
- Both: The Conclave faces impossible choice
- And: Their solution is monstrous
- Both: They're victims of The Helminth
- And: They're perpetrators of genocide
- Complexity without excuse

- Conclave must face Helminth without their farm
- Both worlds lose, but the practice ends

## Visual Representation

**How They're Described (when shown in Book 4+):**

The Conclave exists across dimensions:
- Structures that fold through space
- Cities the size of solar systems
- Dyson spheres around distant stars
- Technology indistinguishable from magic
- Beauty and horror combined
- Incomprehensible scale

**The Intermediary (human-perceivable agent):**
- Androgynous figure in white
- Collapses into themselves and replaces themselves
- Visual glitch made flesh
- Hurts human eyes to observe
- Bridge between dimensions

**Their technology:**
- Fourth-dimensional objects in third-dimensional space
- Impossible geometries
- Clean, precise, alien
- No buttons, no seams, no interface
- Responds to dimensional mathematics, not touch

## Writing Guidelines

### When Writing About The Conclave:

**Do:**
- Emphasize their desperation (they're dying too)
- Show complexity (not pure evil)
- Maintain alien perspective
- Make their technology incomprehensible
- Keep their morality uncomfortable
- Show scale (billions of years, trillions of lives)

**Don't:**
- Make them simple villains
- Let them be defeated by force
- Over-explain their technology
- Humanize them too much
- Forget they're genociding civilizations
- Excuse their actions

### Voice/Description:

**Conclave agents (formal, alien):**
> "Your world is the 848th in our harvest sequence. You are the eighth Temporalist we have observed. All previous worlds reached 100% visibility. All were consumed. Your world will follow this pattern."

**Ahdia's reaction (horror + defiance):**
> "You're farming us. Humanity is livestock. Every person I save, every second I freeze—it's all just fattening us up for slaughter."

**Conclave's justification (cold logic):**
> "We preserve consciousness at the highest level. Third-dimension organisms are ephemeral. We are eternal. The calculus is clear."

## Key Moral Questions

**The series explores:**

1. **Does power justify sacrifice of others?**
   - Conclave says yes (we're more advanced)
   - Ahdia says no (all life equally worthy)

2. **Is survival worth any cost?**
   - Conclave: Yes, even genocide
   - Ahdia: No, not at expense of infinite others

3. **Can systemic evil be excused by circumstance?**
   - Conclave: We face extinction, no choice
   - Ahdia: You chose this solution, others were possible

4. **Who deserves to survive?**
   - Conclave: The most evolved consciousness
   - Ahdia: Everyone, or no one gets special treatment

5. **Is delayed doom worth infinite suffering?**
   - Conclave: Yes, buying time is everything
   - Ahdia: No, ending the practice matters more

## Connection to Mental Health Themes

### The Conclave parallels systems that demand sacrifice:

**Capitalism:**
- Sacrifice infinite labor to preserve wealthy class
- "Necessary evil" justification
- System requires suffering to function

**Ableism:**
- "Higher functioning" worth more
- Productivity determines worth
- Those who can't contribute are disposable

**Utilitarianism:**
- Greatest good for greatest number
- Ignores individual worth
- Math makes atrocity acceptable

**Ahdia's rejection:**
Choosing to be last Temporalist = rejecting the premise that some lives are worth more than others. Theme: **Worthiness is inherent, not earned or ranked.**
