AHDIA: I'm not good at that.

OVERSEER: You could learn.

AHDIA: I could. Don't want to.

OVERSEER: Then you're wasting your potential.

OVERSEER: Ryu, I need analysis in twenty minutes.

RYU: I'll need at least two hours—

OVERSEER: You have twenty minutes.
Prioritize. Approximate. I need direction,
not perfection.

RYU: But the data—

OVERSEER: Twenty minutes.

[Ryu leaves]

HOWITZER: You know they'll do it in eighteen.

OVERSEER: Seventeen. They like to impress me.
```

**Recruitment Pitch:**
```
OVERSEER: CADENS can offer you resources
the Go Squad cannot.

AHDIA: Like what?

OVERSEER: Intelligence. Equipment. Legal protection.
Medical support. Tactical coordination.

AHDIA: And in exchange?

OVERSEER: You follow operational parameters.

AHDIA: Meaning you tell me what to do.

OVERSEER: Meaning we work together
toward common goals.

AHDIA: That's a nice way of saying
"do what we want."

OVERSEER: (slight smile) Yes.

AHDIA: At least you're honest about it.

OVERSEER: I find honesty more efficient than pretense.
```

**With Howitzer (Personal):**
```
HOWITZER: You're drinking in your office again.

OVERSEER: Observant as ever.

HOWITZER: It's 2pm, Harriet.

OVERSEER: (using first name is sign
of their closeness) I'm aware of the time.

HOWITZER: What's bothering you?

OVERSEER: The Bacchus girl.

HOWITZER: Ahdia? What about her?

OVERSEER: She reminds me of who I was.
Before all this.

HOWITZER: Before you became good at it?

OVERSEER: Before I stopped questioning
whether I should.

HOWITZER: You think she'll end up like you?

OVERSEER: God, I hope not.

HOWITZER: Then help her not to.

OVERSEER: ...I'll consider it.

HOWITZER: That's more than you would've
said five years ago.

OVERSEER: We're getting old, Bentley.

HOWITZER: Speak for yourself.

OVERSEER: (actual smile) Get out of my office.

HOWITZER: Yes, ma'am.
```

**Facing Consequences:**
```
POLITICIAN: Your actions were unauthorized!

OVERSEER: My actions prevented
a dimensional incursion that would've
killed half this city.

POLITICIAN: You exceeded your authority—

OVERSEER: I used the authority you gave me.

If you don't like the results,
perhaps you should've given me better options.

POLITICIAN: I could have you removed.

OVERSEER: You could try.

Good luck finding someone else willing
to make the decisions you won't.

[Leaves]
```

**Moment of Vulnerability (Rare):**
```
AHDIA: Do you ever regret it?

OVERSEER: Regret what?

AHDIA: All of it. The sacrifices. The choices.

OVERSEER: (long pause) Every day.

AHDIA: Then why keep doing it?

OVERSEER: Because someone has to.

And I'm already damned.

Might as well be useful on the way down.

AHDIA: That's bleak.

OVERSEER: That's realistic.

AHDIA: Doesn't have to be.

OVERSEER: (quietly) No?

AHDIA: No. You could choose differently.

OVERSEER: I'm too old to change.

AHDIA: You're never too old to choose
who you want to be.

OVERSEER: ...Where were you thirty years ago?

AHDIA: Not born yet.

OVERSEER: (bitter laugh) Of course.

## Quote Collection

**On Duty:**
> "I've made terrible decisions in service of what I believed was right. Whether I was correct... that's for history to judge. I'm too busy preventing the next crisis to dwell on the last."

**On Ahdia:**
> "She has potential to be exceptional. I want to recruit her. I want to protect her from becoming like me. Those desires are incompatible. And yet both are genuine."

**On Morality:**
> "I stopped believing in pure good and pure evil decades ago. Now I believe in marginal improvements and acceptable losses. It's less inspiring. But it keeps people alive."

> "I'm too old to be in the field. Too young to retire. Too tired to care about politics. And too experienced to stop. This is my purgatory."

**On Regret:**
> "Every decision I've made cost someone something. I carry those costs. Not because it absolves me. Because forgetting would mean those sacrifices were meaningless."

**To Howitzer:**
> "Sometimes I wonder who I would've been if I'd made different choices. Then I remember: If I'd made different choices, someone else would be making the terrible ones. At least I lose sleep over it."

**Late Series:**
