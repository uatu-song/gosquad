You're already three steps ahead
without time manipulation.

I just let you be ten steps ahead.

VICTOR: (quiet) I thought I was finally
good at something besides paperwork.

AHDIA: You ARE. You organize people.
You build movements.

### Example Dialogue

**Organizing Mode:**
```
VICTOR: We're not just fighting Kain.
We're fighting the system that created him.

LEAH: So what, we dismantle capitalism first?

VICTOR: We'd need to.
But we can also make Kain's life harder
while we build the movement.

Both/and, not either/or.
```

**With Leah (Their Dynamic):**
```
LEAH: You're overthinking this.
We go in, we punch bad guys, we leave.

VICTOR: And then what?

LEAH: Then we won!

VICTOR: For today.
Tomorrow there are more bad guys.

LEAH: Then we punch them too.

VICTOR: Or we ask: Why are there always more bad guys?
What system creates them?

LEAH: Ugh, you're doing the thing again.

VICTOR: The thinking thing?

LEAH: Yeah, that.

VICTOR: Someone has to.

LEAH: Lucky us.
```

**With Ruth (Intellectual Intimacy):**
```
RUTH: I saved twelve people today in the ER.

VICTOR: And how many came in because
they couldn't afford preventive care?

RUTH: Most of them.

VICTOR: Right. So we save them,
and they come back next week sicker.

RUTH: What's your point?

VICTOR: My point is: We're both trying
to fix problems the system creates.

Maybe together we can actually address causes.

RUTH: (quiet) Is that a metaphor?

VICTOR: For?

RUTH: Us.

VICTOR: ...Maybe.
```

**Post-Reveal Confrontation:**
```
VICTOR: You organized us like we were
a campaign, not a team.

AHDIA: I was trying to help!

VICTOR: I know. But help without consent
is manipulation.

Even with good intentions.

AHDIA: What was I supposed to do?

VICTOR: Tell us the truth.
Let us choose with full information.

That's the difference between
organizing and controlling.

AHDIA: I'm sorry.

VICTOR: I believe you.
I'm still angry.

Both things are true.
```

**On Violence:**
```
BEN: You hesitate too much in a fight.

VICTOR: I'm considering alternatives.

BEN: While someone's punching you.

VICTOR: Violence should be last resort.

BEN: Sometimes it's the only resort.

VICTOR: And that's a failure of imagination.

BEN: Or a success of reality.

VICTOR: (sighs) Probably both.
