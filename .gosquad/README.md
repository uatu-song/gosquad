# Go Squad Knowledge Base

This directory contains the foundational knowledge for the Go Squad book series.

## Structure

Place your knowledge base files here with these recommended names:

- **universe-bible.md** - World building, characters, settings, rules, timeline
- **writing-guide.md** - Writing style, voice, tone, terminology, formatting preferences
- **story-structure.md** - Plot arcs, book outlines, series structure (Books 1-7)
- **development-notes.md** - Latest updates, decisions, continuity notes, things to remember

## Usage

### Quick Context Loading
Run `/gosquad` in any Claude Code session to instantly load all knowledge base files.

### Manual Access
Files can be read individually as needed for reference or updates.

## Maintenance

Keep these files updated as the series develops. The `/gosquad` command will always load the current state of all files.
