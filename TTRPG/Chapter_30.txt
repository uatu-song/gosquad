CHAPTER 30

The glass was cold against Ahdia's forehead.

CADENS command center. Twenty-four hours after downtown. Twenty-four hours since she'd watched her little brother dissolve into light and get pulled into a singularity.

She breathed. Fogged the window. Watched the condensation fade.

"You holding up?" Dr. Ryu's voice behind her. Shiba. She'd started thinking of him as Shiba after spending twelve hours getting debriefed yesterday. First-name basis happened when you almost ended the world together.

"I'm standing," Ahdia said. "That counts for something."

"It does." He moved next to her at the window. Didn't push. Good. She appreciated that. "Overseer wants to see you. When you're ready."

Ahdia nodded. Kept staring out at the hangar. CADENS operatives moving equipment, running diagnostics. Business as usual. Like downtown hadn't almost created a black hole that would've consumed the entire city.

"How's the team?" she asked.

"Checked out clean. No temporal anomalies, no residual Seed energy, no cellular degradation." Shiba adjusted his glasses. "Victor's arm is in a sling but that's from the pull, not the temporal forces. They got lucky."

Lucky. Right. They'd formed a human chain to pull her back from the edge while Firas—

She pushed off the glass. "Let's get this over with."

###

Overseer's office looked the same. Same desk. Same chair. Same woman who'd sent Ahdia into situations without backup and expected results.

"Auerbach. Have a seat."

Ahdia sat. Didn't lean back. Ready to bolt.

"How are you recovering?"

"Fine, just dandy."

"Good." Overseer's expression softened slightly. "I'm very sorry for your loss. I wanted to make sure I told you that."

Sure. Thanks for the condolences after the fact. After not sending support when Ahdia had begged for it. After letting her go in alone against Kain.

"Sure," Ahdia said. Kept her voice neutral. "Thanks."

Overseer knew there was tension. Good. Let her sit with it.

"That was quick thinking yesterday," Overseer said. "Using opposing temporal forces to burn out the Tamois essence while containing the collapse. Impressively, you did it on your own."

"I had the Go Squad," Ahdia corrected. "They formed the chain. Pulled me back. They almost died doing it."

"Of course," Overseer said. "They held their ground against a Terminus-level gravitational anomaly. Unarmed. That takes remarkable courage."

"It probably shouldn't give you ideas," Ahdia said. "It just happened to work out this time. They used timing and positioning. Next time, they die."

"And yet, you let them help. That took guts. Leadership. How did you know the temporal acceleration wouldn't tear them apart?"

"Oh, you know. Most of what we do is guess and theorize because cataclysm science is still in its nascence."

Overseer chuckled, recognizing Shiba in that statement. "Yes, it is."

"I guessed," Ahdia said. "The Seed was channeling through me, not them. They were pulling on flesh and bone, not exotic energy. As long as they stayed outside the acceleration field's direct path, physics would mostly apply."

"That's a hell of a shot in the dark. And your brother—"

"Don't." Ahdia's voice went flat. "Don't analyze that."

Overseer held her gaze for a moment. Nodded. Reached into a desk drawer, pulled something out, tossed it onto the desk.

The CADENS badge.

"It's yours if you want it," Overseer offered.

Ahdia looked at it. Leaned back in her chair now. "I can't use my powers anymore. The Seed's dormant. Maybe permanently."

Overseer shook her head. "We don't value that nearly as much as we value what you bring to the table regardless. Your methods are not CADENS ways of doing things, but that's where you'd be an asset."

Ahdia picked up the badge. Felt the weight. Cold metal. Official. A life that wasn't hers.

She put it back on the desk.

"I'm flattered," she said. "But I'm ready to go back to my life. The couch has been booty calling me."

Overseer smiled. Disappointed but appreciative. "Let me know if you ever change your mind. Until then, I trust you can keep CADENS under your hat."

Ahdia mimed zipping her lips, throwing away the key. "It's not like you won't have FAERIS tracking me anyway."

"We have no reason to monitor you anymore, Ms. Bacchus." Overseer stood. Ahdia stood too.

They shook hands.

"It's been a pleasure and a privilege," Overseer said.

Ahdia gave a side smile. Turned to leave.

"One last thing." Overseer's voice stopped her. "How close did you come to draining all of your life force yesterday?"

Ahdia blinked slowly. Considered answering. Considered telling her about the hallway, about seeing Bellatrix, about dissolving into light and nearly not coming back.

Instead, she smiled.

Overseer watched her leave. Sat back down. Pushed the intercom button.

"Please send in Dr. Ryu," she requested.

"Yes, ma'am," the voice replied.


Ruth, Leah, Victor in an arm sling, Ben and Tess sat in Ahdia's penthouse. CADENS had released them that morning after twelve hours of medical checks and debriefing. No temporal anomalies. No cellular degradation. Just exhaustion and Victor's pulled shoulder from the human chain.

They'd agreed to meet here. Process yesterday together before going back to their lives.

If they could.

"Welcome to Carl Tucker Tonight," the cable news anchor greeted from the TV. The team sat scattered around the living room, not quite looking at each other. "When the nation's first response to prank calls from some yahoos with too much time on their hands is to scream like chicken little that the sky is falling, we have to wonder what kind of leadership we have currently steering the ship. Just because officials have a hint of something possibly happening, in this case a supposed critical gas leak in the city's center, all of Caledonia gets completely evacuated? The National Guard gets called in? Where were they while crime has been running rampant and overwhelming our city's noble police force…?"
"I wish they let us keep the suits," Victor complained, clicking off the TV.
"Lot of good it did you," Ben joked.
"My arm might have been taken clean off without it!" Victor responded.
"We don't need them," Ruth said.
"Right," Victor agreed. "We already have 'uniforms'. Still… being bulletproof…"
"I mean we don't need them because we're done," Ruth clarified. "The Go Squad. It's all over."
Tess chafed in her seat. "What? Why?"
"Guys… come on. Do I have to spell out why?" Ruth asked.
"We have the proof to expose the cops," Leah offered.
"And my consumer advocacy group has filed a lawsuit against the money we paid to the Kain PAC," Victor added. "Ahdia may not get her money back but neither will Kain. That money will get frozen."
"And?" Ruth challenged. "You guys know Kain is no worse off than before, right? He's already rebuilding his mansion. His campaign is just rolling right along. What we do… what we're done with now is and has been insignificant."
"When we expose the Police Chief, it's gotta connect to him, though," Ben said.
"Wrong," Victor said. "Ruth's right. It'll connect to the PAC. His hands will be clean."
"And what about Ahdia?" Ruth continued. "We haven't seen her since yesterday. Since downtown. Where is she? She just sends me access to her penthouse and bank account and doesn't make contact? No, there are too many reasons we need to keep laying low. The Go Squad is too dangerous. Anyway, we're not the Go Squad without Firas. He started all this. It was always his."
"Ruth…" Leah said.
"What?" Ruth replied.
"You've been holding us together," Leah said quietly. "Since it happened. Since he—" She stopped. Couldn't finish. "You're the one who made sure we all got out. You organized the chain. You've been carrying us."
Ruth looked at her deeply, then connected one by one with the others, each nodding when she did.
"Okay," she said, wiping a tear from her eye. "Then listen to me now… this world… doesn't need us. We're just a bunch of crazies running around, hopping around rooftops in our pajamas in the middle of the night. And we just lost—" Her voice cracked. "We just lost Firas. Yesterday. He's gone and that's—" She stopped. Breathed. "That's as much of a price I'm willing to pay to keep doing this. I can't lose any of you, too."
"You won't," Ahdia said.
They all turned to see her standing in the doorway, her hands buried in her bomber coat. Ruth smiled as soon as she saw that it was her. Then, Ruth noticed a duffel bag by her feet.
	###
"Dr. Ryu, come in," Overseer said as he entered her office. "Have a seat."
He sat down and fixed his tie nervously.
"Are you anxious, doctor?" Overseer asked.
"No," he lied. "Why? Do I seem anxious?"
"It's why I asked," she said.
"Well… I thought maybe you were calling me in here to admonish me for letting Auerbach leave the facility early."
"No, I understand why you did." Overseer pulled up a holographic display. Medical scans. "But we need to discuss what happened with the treatment protocol."
Shiba leaned forward, adjusting his glasses. "Ma'am?"
"She lied to us." Overseer highlighted a section of the scan. "The eighth treatment. The one she told you she'd completed before leaving the facility."
"She didn't take it." Shiba's face fell.
"Medical analysis confirms she left at approximately one-third cellular recovery. Far below combat readiness, let alone channeling opposing temporal forces through her body." Overseer closed the display. "She walked into a Terminus-level event critically compromised. It's a miracle she's alive."
"That was... tactically unsound," Shiba said carefully.
"It was reckless. And effective." Overseer's expression was unreadable. "Which brings me to the second issue. Kain."
Shiba blinked. "I'm sorry, ma'am. I thought—downtown, the singularity—"
"You saw the press conference this morning?" Overseer pulled up another display. News footage. Harding Kain, very much alive, standing at a podium.
"I was dealing with equipment inventory," Shiba admitted.
Overseer played the clip. Kain's voice, smooth and practiced: "—tragic incident involving what appeared to be an experimental weapon. We believe this was an attempt by criminal elements to impersonate me and destabilize my campaign. I was, thankfully, nowhere near downtown at the time. The authorities are investigating—"
She muted it. "He's spinning it. Claims the entity at the singularity was a lookalike. Some kind of bioweapon or cataclysm construct."
"That's..." Shiba searched for words. "That's absurd. We have footage. Thermal signatures. Energy readings from the Tamois Heart in his chest."
"And he has lawyers. And a story that doesn't require the public to believe in cosmic artifacts and temporal singularities." Overseer leaned back. "We can't touch him. Not officially."
"The authorization," Shiba said quietly.
"The authorization that never came." Overseer's voice was flat. "I requested executive clearance to intervene six hours before Auerbach went downtown. Do you know when I received it?"
Shiba waited.
"Forty-seven minutes ago," Overseer said. "Fourteen hours after the event concluded. With a note thanking us for our 'patience and restraint during the review process.'"
Shiba sat back. "They wanted us hamstrung."
"They wanted plausible deniability. If Auerbach failed, no connection to CADENS. If she succeeded, no political fallout from officially acknowledging cataclysm threats." Overseer closed all the displays. "Either way, Kain walks free. We're left cleaning up gravitational anomalies and explaining to city officials why downtown looks like a meteor strike."
Silence filled the office.
"So what do we do, ma'am?" Shiba finally asked.
Overseer looked out the window at the hangar bay. "We document everything. We build the file. And we wait."
"For what?"
"For Kain to make a mistake. For the authorization to mean something. For whoever's pulling strings above us to realize that threats like this don't go away just because we pretend they don't exist." She turned back to Shiba. "In the meantime, we do our job. Monitor cataclysm activity. Track the Seed-bearers. And hope that next time, a depressed girl with time powers and a death wish isn't our only line of defense."
	###
"Guys," Ahdia started. "I just wanted to say… thank you."
They all replied with acceptances and rejections of the gratitude all at once. Once they stopped, they kept their eyes on her because she was still standing there, looking like she had more to say.
"You guys saved my life yesterday. Downtown. The singularity." Ahdia's voice was quiet but steady. "When I was channeling those opposing forces, when I went... somewhere else... you pulled me back. Formed that chain and hauled me out of a collapsing dimension. You guys are..." She smiled slightly. "You're super."
This time, they stayed quiet, a pride welling in each of them.
"Even without me helping you in the background, you guys are real, genuine heroes. You inspired me to get off the couch and do something worth a damn. At first, I thought it was just to prove to Firas that I wasn't a screwup. I've learned so much about you guys and about myself since then. And what I've learned… is that this city needs us. This world, this universe, this dimension and all others. Between the corrupt cops, to Kain and the people who support that madman, and things happening that people don't know about, cataclysms that either provide unthinkable advances for humanity or threatens it entirely. I know I can't go back to my life the way it was before you guys but you're the only family I have and my family is unbeatable."
	###
"How can we say no to that?" Tess said, smiling and wiping a tear.
"We don't," Victor said. "We keep up the fight. We stay vigilant. We stay ready."
"And we help the people who need it the most," Leah added.
"Because there's no one but us," Ben said.
They all looked at Ruth.
"This doesn't work without you, boss," Ahdia said.
	###
"If we do this," Ruth said, "we start over. Build it up from the bottom because we're not just beating up muggers and getting old ladies safely across the street anymore."
The Go Squad began to smile, seeing Ruth come around.
"We need to be ready for cataclysms, cops and Kain," she added.
"Oh, my," Leah tagged on.
Victor put her in a playful headlock with his good arm and she put her arms around him in return.
"So…?" Ahdia asked, wanting a confirmation.
Ruth bit her lip and squinted in thought.

###

As the sun set on Caledonia, five figures stood at the top of an ivory tower, the highest point of the city. They wore form-fitting tactical suits—not the CADENS armor from yesterday, but their own gear. Custom. Familiar. Theirs.

They walked to the edge and looked down as the wind whipped.

"All clear," Ahdia said through their earwig comms from inside the MCC on the roof of her penthouse. The stolen CADENS mobile command center hummed softly as it cloaked, becoming invisible. "Happy hunting."

"Copy," Ruth said, finishing her climb up the roof access. She checked in with the squad—Leah, Victor (favoring his bad arm but here anyway), Ben, Tess—nodding at each one before stepping onto the ledge.

She turned back to them.

"This is it," Ruth said. "Yesterday, we lost someone. Today, we keep going. Because that's what Firas would've wanted. Because people still need help. Because we're the Go Squad, and we go when nobody else will." She paused. "It's not just Caledonia anymore. Not just muggers and corrupt cops. It's singularities and cosmic entities and things we don't have names for yet. No better place."

"No better time," the team said together.

Ruth dove.

The others followed.

Ahdia watched on the monitors as the FAERIS drones tracked their movements. They fell into formation. Leah and Ben peeled off first, deploying wingsuits, gliding to their patrol zones. Victor and Tess went next, splitting opposite directions.

Ruth dove faster, passing the lowest buildings before deploying her wingsuit. She pulled up to level off, hurtling overhead through the avenue. The HUD in her goggles lit up with police activity.

"You got it, Ahdia?" Ruth radioed.

"Everyone's in position," Ahdia replied. "Ready when you are."

Ruth retracted her wings, tucked into a roll, hit the rooftop across from a robbery in progress. The landing was textbook.

And then—

She levitated. Just slightly. Just enough. The gift Ahdia had given them all, now channeled through stolen CADENS equipment. Still working.

Ruth's feet touched down gently.

"Thank you," she said into her radio.

From the stolen MCC, surrounded by monitors and illegally repurposed FAERIS systems, Ahdia watched her team touch down across the city. The technology hummed around her—tech she wasn't authorized to use, in a vehicle she'd taken without permission, supporting vigilantes CADENS officially didn't acknowledge.

Overseer wanted her to wait. To document. To build files.

But people still needed help tonight.

Ahdia replied, "Go get 'em. I got your back."
