## 🚫 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ "She walked slowly and quietly through the door"
✅ "She crept through the door"

### 2. Passive Voice in Action
❌ "The villain was defeated by the hero"
✅ "The hero defeated the villain"

### 3. Over-Explaining Powers
❌ "She teleported, using her quantum displacement ability to shift her molecular structure across spacetime"
✅ "She teleported. Appeared across the room."

### 4. Dialogue Tags Instead of Beats
❌ "I don't know," she said nervously
✅ "I don't know." She glanced at the door

### 5. Info Dumping
❌ Three paragraphs of world-building exposition
✅ World-building through dialogue and action
