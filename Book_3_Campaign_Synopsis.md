# Book 3 Campaign 01 - Synopsis

## What This Is

A dice-based TTRPG campaign generating scenes for Book 3 through emergent storytelling. Like Book 2's planning system, but instead of pre-planning 12 months, we're rolling dice to discover what happens scene by scene.

**Method:** Roll d10 + character competency vs difficulty. Success/failure and random costs drive the narrative forward organically.

## Three Major Story Arcs

### Arc 1: FAERIS Unit 7 Origin Story (Scenes 1-10)
**When:** Days 1-1251 (~3.5 years, happens 22 years before Book 3)
**Purpose:** Establish the Ryu/FAERIS bond that becomes crucial in Book 3

**Key Moments:**
- **Scene 2:** FAERIS discovers Ryu sees her true form (winged light, not drone shell)
- **Scene 3:** Ryu discovers FAERIS prioritizes agent survival over mission objectives
- **Scenes 4-9:** Prime's failed timelines montage - THREE assassination attempts across three different utopias (Timeline Alpha: egalitarian, Timeline Beta: liberty, Timeline Gamma: perfection)
- **Scene 9 (Critical):** Geneva reveals herself as Bellatrix during third assassination attempt
- **Scene 10:** FAERIS calculates: Ryu's presence = Prime's survival differential across all timelines

**Emergent Theme:** Unit 7 learning that protecting people you care about matters more than following orders.

---

### Arc 2: Book 1-2 Era Bonds (Scenes 11-28)
**When:** Days 7300-7946 (Book 1-2 timeframe)
**Purpose:** Show relationships forming under pressure, set up Book 3 vulnerabilities

**Key Moments:**

**Ryu & FAERIS Bond:**
- **Scene 12 (CRITICAL FAILURE):** FAERIS breaks formation to protect Ahdia, takes damage, waits for Ryu's confirmation before retreating (rolled 1)
- **Scene 13:** Ryu personally repairs Unit 7, thanks her for prioritizing Ahdia
- **Scene 14 (CRITICAL FAILURE):** Ryu calculates Ahdia will die by Month 11, hides data from CADENS (rolled 1 despite competency 9)
- **Scene 15:** FAERIS proves Ryu extended Ahdia's timeline by 3 months within constraints (not absolution, but accuracy)
- **Scene 16:** Leta's death - Unit 7 watches Ryu frozen at console, broadcasts to network: "Ryu is breaking"
- **Scene 17:** Election Night - Network perceives Prime's three collapsed timelines where Ryu was absent/blocked

**Ahdia's Struggle:**
- **Scene 19 (CRITICAL FAILURE):** Ahdia's parkour training without powers - she gets injured (rolled 1)
- **Scene 20 (CRITICAL SUCCESS):** Ruth treats injury and confronts Ahdia about overconfidence (rolled 10)
- **Scene 24 (SUCCESS):** Second encounter with Ahdia Prime (after Book 2 Month 12 reveal) - continuing their relationship from perfection timeline (9 vs 8, relationship friction)
- **Scene 25 (BARE SUCCESS):** Ahdia Prime attempts to connect with Ahdia Bacchus, share perspective from Timeline Gamma (7 vs 7, exact tie, missed connection)

**Clone War Discovery:**
- **Scene 21 (CRITICAL SUCCESS):** Tess & Korede discover coordinated clone pattern (rolled 10)
- **Scene 22:** Ben's first clone encounter - discovers they have Temporalist abilities
- **Scene 27:** Leah reports 50+ active clone avatars, coordinated patterns emerging

**Emergent Theme:** Mutual vulnerability creating bonds. Both FAERIS and Ryu had critical failures at moments of caring = shared understanding of complicity and protection.

**Ahdia's Breaking Point:**
- **Scene 40 (CRITICAL FAILURE):** Ahdia completely breaks down when CADENS is lost - her one anchor to legitimacy is gone (rolled 1)
  - **Cost:** "Prime intervenes (manipulation exposed)" - Prime has to save her, revealing his controlling nature to the team

**Team Fracture:**

- **Scene 42 (SUCCESS):** Prime defends his actions to the team, convinces some, but emotionally strained

  - **Cost:** "Relationship friction (deepens existing tension)" - The question neither of them can escape

**Emergent Theme:** Ahdia Bacchus watching a version of herself who isn't broken - living proof she's obsolete. The question that can't be unasked.

## Key Characters & Competencies

**High Competency (consistently succeed):**
- **Ryu:** 9 (highest) - but still had critical failure when emotionally compromised
- **Ruth:** 8 - medical/emotional support anchor

**Solid Competency (stressed but capable):**
- **Ahdia (original):** 7 - but degraded to 5 when tracked as "Ahdia Bacchus"
- **Ben, Tess, Victor:** 7

**Standard Competency (baseline):**
- **Most others including Kain, Prime, FAERIS, Ahdia Prime, clones:** 5
- **Leah:** 6

---

## Recurring Cost Patterns (What the Dice Are Telling Us)

**"Team trust strained"** - Appears **16 times**
- The team is fragmenting. Every success fractures trust further.

**"Minor injury (bruised, strained)"** - Appears **14 times**
- Everyone is physically and emotionally exhausted.

**"Missed connection"** - Appears **8 times**
- Always one step behind, missing crucial moments while dealing with crises.

**"Prime intervenes (manipulation exposed)"** - Appears **3 times**
- Prime's controlling nature revealed at worst possible moments.

**"Relationship friction"** - Growing tension in personal relationships
**"Position exposed"** - Tactical vulnerabilities mounting

---

## Critical Moments (Rolled 1 or 10)

### Critical Successes (Rolled 10):
1. Prime survives Timeline Gamma assassination (Bellatrix reveals herself)
2. Ruth treats Ahdia's training injury perfectly
3. Tess & Korede discover clone pattern
4. Bentley establishes secure comms with Go Squad
5. Go Squad's perfect ambush (Scene 44)
6. Clone's perfect escape (Scene 45)
7. Ahdia Bacchus's breakthrough processing failure (Scene 46)
8. Ahdia Prime effortlessly defeating clone with powers (Scene 55)
9. Ahdia Bacchus asks devastating question "What's it like to be whole?" (Scene 60)

### Critical Failures (Rolled 1):
1. FAERIS damaged protecting Ahdia (broke formation out of care)
2. Ryu hiding Ahdia's terminal data from CADENS (chose her over duty)
3. Ahdia's parkour training injury (overconfidence without powers)
4. Ahdia's complete breakdown losing CADENS (Prime's manipulation exposed)

**Pattern:** Critical failures happen at moments of emotional vulnerability or care. Critical successes show technical excellence but often create new problems (perfect hunt = perfect escape = clone learns).

---

## Current Status (End of Scene 60)

**Ahdia Bacchus:**
- Baseline: 0.7% CRITICAL (cannot use powers without transcending)
- Confidence: 8/10 (but brittle - one crit failure from collapse)
- Just watched her "perfect self" effortlessly do what she can't
- Asked Ahdia Prime "What's it like to be whole?" in a moment of devastating honesty
- CADENS (her legitimacy anchor) is gone
- Team questions if she's a liability

**Team Cohesion:** 6/10 (fraying)
- Prime's manipulation exposed
- Split up and position exposed to Kain
- Trust strained across 16+ scenes

**Tactical Situation:**
- CADENS hostile (Kain/TRIOMF control)
- Operating independently with no institutional support
- Clone avatars escalating (exact count not tracked, estimated 50+)
- Kain identified Ahdia as weak link

**Relationship Dynamics:**
- Ryu & FAERIS: Deep bond through mutual "failures" of caring
- Prime & two Ahdias: Torn between perfect partner and broken version he's trying to save, explanation of why he kept them separate exposed as failure
- Ahdia Bacchus & Ahdia Prime: The devastating question asked and now hanging between them - "What's it like to be whole?"
- Ruth: Witnessed the meeting, processing what this means for her friend
- Go Squad: Exhausted, fractured, but held together by Ryu's mediation

## What This Means for Book 3

The dice-driven storytelling is creating the exact psychological collapse Book 3 needs:

1. **Not losing dramatically, but ERODING** - Winning fights but losing cohesion
2. **Every success has a cost** - No clean victories
3. **The incomprehensible challenge isn't tactical** - It's that winning doesn't matter when you're fragmenting from within
4. **Ahdia Prime as living contrast** - "Perfect timeline Ahdia" makes Ahdia Bacchus's brokenness unbearable
5. **Prime's manipulation exposed** - At the exact moment they need unity most
6. **CADENS gone** - Ahdia's legitimacy and institutional anchor destroyed

This is **"Confidence → Incomprehensible challenge → Psychological collapse"** played out through dice rolls.

---

## Next Steps

**Continue generating scenes showing:**
1. Clone war escalation (increase clone_avatar_count, eidolon_activity, team_exhaustion metrics)
2. Cost accumulation breaking point
3. Ahdia Bacchus vs Ahdia Prime dynamic deepening
4. Team cohesion dropping below critical threshold
5. The moment where CBT approach definitively fails

**Goal:** Build toward the psychological breaking point that necessitates Book 4's DBT introduction.
