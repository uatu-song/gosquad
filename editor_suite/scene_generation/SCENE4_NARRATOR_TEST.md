# Scene 4 Narrator Voice Test

**Purpose:** Compare old format (neutral narrator) vs new format (Ahdia-filtered narrator)

**Scene:** Book 2, Chapter 1, Scene 4 - The Penthouse (team debrief after riot)

**Context:**
- Ahdia just woke from 4 hours unconscious after 47-minute freeze
- Baseline dropped 90% → 67-68%
- Saved 23 people, lost Daniel Okonkwo (31, accountant)
- Team using her penthouse as HQ (her idea—trying to be part of something)
- Kain on TV campaigning on the riot
- Mystery figure glimpsed on rooftop (purple lightning)

---

## BASELINE: Old Format (Neutral Narrator)

```markdown
[NARRATOR]: The penthouse was full of people. Leah sat on the couch with her boots on the coffee table. Victor leaned against the wall near the windows. Ruth sat in the corner of the couch. Tess stood near the door. Ben had his tablet out.

The news played on one of the screens. Kain was giving a press conference about the riot.

[AS RUTH, team leader, medical authority]:
"This isn't crime. This is political operation."

[AS BEN, former Marine, investigating]:
"The provocateurs weren't activists. Same boots on four different guys. Tactical footwear."

[NARRATOR]: Ahdia stood by the window, looking out at the city. The rooftop across the plaza was empty.

[AS TESS, Gen Z, sarcastic]:
"I swear, I thought we murdered that guy."

[NARRATOR]: No one laughed. Kain kept talking on the screen. The team kept planning. Ahdia watched and listened.
```

**Analysis of Old Format:**
- Neutral camera observing events
- Descriptions objective ("sat," "stood," "leaned")
- No Ahdia filtering or bias
- Emotional state stated rather than embodied in prose rhythm
- Could be any POV character watching this scene

## TEST 1: New Format (Ahdia-Filtered Narrator)

```markdown
[AS NARRATOR - AHDIA POV, post-trauma, hypervigilant, trying-to-belong]:
There were people in her apartment.

She'd invited them. This was her idea. "Use the penthouse," she'd said, like a person who has people over. Like someone who does that regularly and doesn't find it deeply weird to have other humans breathing the same air as her.

Leah had her boots on the coffee table. Victor was leaning against the wall where Ahdia usually stood when she was dissociating at 3 AM. Ruth was in *her* spot on the couch—the spot with the perfect view of all four screens, the spot where the cushion had molded to the exact shape of Ahdia's depression.

This was what she wanted. Teammates. A team. People who showed up.

It was just... a lot. A lot of people. In her space. Existing near her.

She'd get used to it. Probably.

[AS RUTH, team leader, medical precision]:
"This isn't crime. This is political operation."

[AS NARRATOR - AHDIA POV]:
Ruth had that tone—the one where she was already three moves ahead but needed to bring everyone else along. Ahdia recognized it from every heist planning scene in every Ocean's movie.

Except this wasn't a heist. This was "who funded a riot and why."

[AS BEN, former Marine, methodical]:
"The provocateurs weren't activists. Look at this—same boots on four different guys. Tactical footwear, not protest gear. They moved in formation."

[AS NARRATOR - AHDIA POV]:
Ben was doing his serial killer investigation board thing again. Papers spread everywhere, swiping through images on his tablet like he was tracking down a Netflix documentary villain.

Which, okay, he basically was.

[AS TESS, Gen Z, flat delivery]:
"I swear, I thought we murdered that guy."

[AS NARRATOR - AHDIA POV]:
Nobody laughed. Nobody disagreed. The words just sat there, heavy and true.

On the screen, Kain kept talking. Ahdia could read his lips even with the sound off. *Leadership. Safety. Order.* Words that meant nothing, words that meant everything, words that would be on campaign signs by morning.

She should be part of this. She should be paying attention, contributing, being a teammate.

But her eyes kept drifting to the window.

The city at night. All those lights. All those people who went home safe because she'd held time still for forty-seven minutes.

Minus one.

Daniel Okonkwo. Thirty-one. Accountant.
```

**Analysis of Test 1:**
- Narrator IS Ahdia's perception, not camera
- "her spot on the couch" / "the cushion had molded to the exact shape of Ahdia's depression"
- Self-conscious internal commentary ("like a person who has people over")
- Pop culture processing ("Ocean's movie," "Netflix documentary villain")
- Flat dark statement at end (Daniel Okonkwo)
- Rhythm matches emotional state (choppy sentences during overwhelm)
- What she notices: cushion shape, boots on table, Victor in her dissociation spot
- What she's probably missing: social cues about how team feels about using her space

## TEST 2: New Format (Second Generation)

```markdown
[AS NARRATOR - AHDIA POV, grief-functional, overstimulated, connection-resistant]:
People kept showing up in her apartment.

She'd said they could. That was the problem. Past-Ahdia making decisions Present-Ahdia had to live with. Classic.

The penthouse wasn't built for six people and a wall of tactical planning. It was built for one depressed hermit and an unhealthy TV habit. Now it was—what? Go Squad HQ? The Justice League watchtower, except everyone brought coffee and trauma instead of superpowers?

Well. She had the superpowers. The others had the functional social skills. Maybe it balanced out.

[AS RUTH, ER doctor, already strategizing]:
"This isn't crime. This is political operation."

[AS NARRATOR - AHDIA POV]:
Ruth said it like she was delivering a diagnosis. Which, for her, she probably was. Ruth saw the world in symptoms and treatments. This was just a bigger patient.

[AS BEN, ex-Marine, boots-on-ground]:
"The provocateurs weren't activists. Same boots. Four guys. Tactical footwear."

[AS NARRATOR - AHDIA POV]:
Ben had that thing military guys did where they noticed shoes first. Shoes and sight lines. Ahdia noticed snack arrangements and whether someone had changed the channel. Different threat detection systems.

[AS LEAH, roller derby jammer, restless]:
"So what, we're fighting a campaign?"

[AS NARRATOR - AHDIA POV]:
Leah's boots were on the coffee table. Her nice coffee table. The one that probably cost more than Leah made in a month at The Bean Post.

Ahdia didn't say anything. That's what teammates did. They let people put boots on things.

[AS RUTH]:
"We're fighting someone who can orchestrate a riot, control the police response, and turn it into a campaign ad within hours."

[AS NARRATOR - AHDIA POV]:
Within hours. Ahdia had been unconscious for four of those hours. Passed out on a CADENS gurney while Kain spun the whole thing into a narrative.

She'd frozen time for forty-seven minutes and it still wasn't fast enough.

One of the screens flickered. Kain's face. That specific political smile that said *I own this moment.*

[AS TESS, flat, dark]:
"I swear, I thought we murdered that guy."

[AS NARRATOR - AHDIA POV]:
The silence that followed was the kind that agreed with you and wished you hadn't said it out loud.

Kain kept smiling on the screen. Ahdia thought about the rooftop across the plaza. Empty now.

Probably always was.

Probably.
```

**Analysis of Test 2:**
- Different Ahdia observations than Test 1 (shoes vs cushion, coffee table cost)
- Past-Ahdia/Present-Ahdia framing (self-aware humor)
- "Justice League watchtower" reference embedded naturally
- Boots-on-coffee-table as class observation, not just visual
- Rhythm variation: "Shoes and sight lines." vs flowing sentences
- Ends on uncertainty (rooftop, "Probably.") rather than flat statement
- What she notices: time (4 hours unconscious while Kain spun story)
- What she's missing: her teammates' emotional states during planning

## TEST 3: New Format (Third Generation)

```markdown
[AS NARRATOR - AHDIA POV, exhausted, baseline-depleted, trying-to-participate]:
Six people in her living room.

Five of them belonged here more than she did, which was impressive given that she owned the place. Or her dead parents owned it. Or her dead parents' money owned it. The taxonomy of inheritance was complicated and she didn't have the bandwidth for it right now.

Leah had claimed the armchair like she'd been sitting there for years. Victor stood by the window—her window, the one with the best view of the city burning, if you were into that sort of thing. Ruth sat on the couch running tactical scenarios in her head, probably. Ben had his investigation board face on.

Tess was somewhere. Being Tess. Ahdia had lost track of her in the mental inventory and that felt metaphorically significant but she didn't have the energy to unpack it.

[AS RUTH, doctor-who-also-fights-crime, diagnostic]:
"This isn't crime. This is political operation."

[AS NARRATOR - AHDIA POV]:
Ruth delivered information like she was briefing a surgical team. Here's the problem. Here's what we're cutting out. Here's the survival rate if we screw up.

Ahdia appreciated it. Clarity was nice. Clarity was easy to hold onto when everything else was sliding.

[AS BEN, ex-Marine, evidence-mode]:
"Provocateurs. Professional. Same boots, four guys. Formation movement."

[AS NARRATOR - AHDIA POV]:
Ben talked in fragments when he was deep in tactical mode. Subject. Object. Threat. Like full sentences were for people who had time to waste.

She should take notes. That seemed like a teammate thing to do. She didn't have a pen. She didn't move to get one.

[AS VICTOR, community organizer, quiet]:
"Isaiah deserved better than this."

[AS NARRATOR - AHDIA POV]:
Nobody argued with that. Nobody could.

Isaiah Bennett. The name on the signs. The reason two thousand people gathered in a plaza to say his name out loud.

Now there was another name. Daniel Okonkwo. Thirty-one. Accountant.

Isaiah got signs. Got protests. Got a riot turned into a campaign ad.

Daniel got... what? A line in a casualty report. A girlfriend waking up alone.

[AS TESS, Gen Z, deadpan]:
"I swear, I thought we murdered that guy."

[AS NARRATOR - AHDIA POV]:
Tess said it about Kain. The guy on the screen. The guy who was currently winning the news cycle while they planned in her living room.

They HAD tried to kill him. Book 1. The warehouse. All that chaos.

He'd walked it off. He'd walked everything off.

Ahdia's eyes found the window. The rooftop across the plaza.

Someone had been standing there. Purple light. A figure.

The rooftop was empty now.

She was tired. She was hallucinating. She was seeing things that weren't there because her brain was running on 67% of its usual baseline and that was before you factored in the four hours of unconsciousness and the forty-seven minutes of frozen time.

She looked away.

When she looked back, the rooftop was still empty.

Good. Fine. Normal.

She'd get used to it.
```

**Analysis of Test 3:**
- Opens with "Five of them belonged here more than she did"—insecurity filter
- Dead parents' money framing (flat dark statement buried in logistics)
- "lost track of Tess... metaphorically significant but didn't have energy"—self-aware
- Daniel Okonkwo juxtaposed with Isaiah—what she's actually thinking about
- Fragments when describing Ben's speech pattern, reflecting Ahdia's own fatigue
- Extended rooftop sequence—her trying to explain away what she saw
- Ends on false reassurance ("She'd get used to it")
- What she notices: who belongs, inheritance guilt, the difference in how deaths are remembered
- What she's missing: actively participating in the planning conversation

## Comparison Summary

| Aspect | Old Format | New Format |
|--------|------------|------------|
| POV | Neutral camera | Ahdia's perception |
| Details selected | Generic (who's where) | Character-revealing (cushion shape, coffee table cost, inheritance guilt) |
| Emotional state | Stated or implied | Embodied in prose rhythm and attention |
| Pop culture | Absent | Natural processing tool |
| Dark statements | None | Flat and undecorated |
| Rhythm | Consistent | Varies with mental state |
| Self-awareness | None | High (comments on own observations) |
| Missing cues | N/A | Built in (what she doesn't notice) |

## Validation Questions

For each Test output, ask:

1. **Could this have been written about any protagonist?**
   - Old: Yes
   - Tests 1-3: No—specific to Ahdia's brain

2. **Is there at least one pop culture reference that isn't a simile?**
   - Test 1: "serial killer investigation board" (embedded comparison)
   - Test 2: "Justice League watchtower" (question format)
   - Test 3: None explicit, but "running on 67%" is engineering-brain

3. **Does she resolve her own questions?**
   - Tests 1-3: No—ends on uncertainty ("Probably," "She'd get used to it")

4. **Is there a detail only she would notice?**
   - Test 1: Cushion shape of her depression
   - Test 2: Coffee table cost vs Leah's barista wages
   - Test 3: Dead parents' money taxonomy

5. **Is there something she's probably missing?**
   - Test 1: How team feels about using her space
   - Test 2: Teammates' emotional states
   - Test 3: She doesn't participate in the actual planning

---

## Conclusion

The new format produces:
- Consistent Ahdia voice across multiple generations
- Variable specific details (different each time, but all character-appropriate)
- Proper rhythm matching emotional state
- Built-in limitations (what she notices vs misses)
- Natural integration of voice tools (flat statements, self-interruption, dark humor)

**Status:** System validated. Ready for production use.
