## PROSE BEATS

### Scene 1: Downtown Caledonia - Peaceful Protest
1. Isaiah Bennett memorial protest: 2,000 peaceful protesters, families, community demanding accountability for police killing 6-8 months prior
2. Go Squad monitors from rooftops - Ahdia jokes about "watching people not commit crimes," Ruth explains protective presence
3. Leta speaks to crowd about solidarity, Korede filming nearby with pride, Victor teaching protest safety
4. 6:47 PM: Crowd energy shifts suddenly - Leah feels tension spike, Ahdia's powers sense electromagnetic distortion (Eidolon's fear amplification beginning)
5. Three professional agitators in black bloc appear, move with military precision toward center
6. First provocateur throws bottle at police, police charge immediately (pre-planned response), chaos erupts in seconds
7. Crowd stampedes - 2,000 people fleeing, families separated, elderly knocked down, tear gas fired indiscriminately

### Scene 2: Frozen Time - Crowd Control
8. Ahdia activates time freeze seeing child about to be crushed, world goes purple-tinted and silent
9. Works methodically through frozen tableau for 47 minutes subjective time - repositions 23 people away from certain death (protesters AND police both)
10. Moral calculations: saves protester from fatal baton strike, redirects brick to miss officer - "refereeing a fight frozen in time"
11. Spots Korede about to run into tear gas, uses last reserves to move him to safety
12. HUD shows critical cellular degradation warnings throughout, nosebleed increasing, vision blurring
13. Time freeze collapses, Ahdia falls unconscious, world explodes back into motion

### Scene 3: Aftermath - Medical Triage
14. Ruth stabilizes collapsed Ahdia - "Don't move. You burned through—I don't even know how much lifespan"
15. Casualty count: Ahdia saved 23, 16 still died, more critical - guilt loads ("Not enough. Never enough")
16. News crews arrive already framing story: "Peaceful protest turned violent as radical agitators attacked police"
17. Kain's live press conference on nearby phone: campaigns on riot he orchestrated, "Law and order! Kain 2024!"
18. Ben identifies agent provocateurs from Tess's footage: "Professional. Not activists. This was a job"
19. Mystery figure watches from distant rooftop - can't see face, but purple lightning flickers around hands before disappearing

### Scene 4: Go Squad Debrief - Safe House
20. Team processes new threat level: "We're not fighting crime anymore. We're fighting a political operation"
21. Ruth confronts Ahdia about costs: "Forty-seven minutes, Ahdia. You can't save everyone by burning yourself out"
22. Korede thanks Ahdia for saving him, Leta grateful for brother's life, team debates acceptable costs
23. New mission parameters established: Ben investigates orchestration, Tess warns activist networks, Leah monitors social media manipulation
24. Ruth: "This is bigger than us. But we do what we can" / Ahdia alone with Kain's speech on repeat: "This is going to get worse before it gets better"

## MUST-HITS

- Ahdia burns 47 minutes frozen time, massive lifespan cost → Establishes power limitations for entire book, medical dependency arc
- Saves 23 people including Korede specifically → Korede's gratitude matters for his Book 3 recruitment
- Agent provocateurs with military precision → Ben's investigation thread, leads to Tank Kain discovery
- Eidolon's fear amplification (unnamed) → Major Book 2 antagonist, team doesn't know entity exists yet
- Mystery figure with purple lightning watching Ahdia → Ahdia-Prime reveal, watching her deteriorate
- 16 people die despite Ahdia's efforts → "Can't save everyone" guilt, Ruth's arc about leadership limits
- Kain campaigns on orchestrated riot → Political operation scope, sets up Geneva assassination escalation
- Team realizes they're fighting political coordination → Mission evolution from street crime to political investigation
- Leta/Korede present, grateful to Ahdia → Establishes relationships before Leta's death in Chapter 21
- Ben identifies professional agitators → Military intelligence skills, will trace back to TRIOMF network
- Ruth confronts Ahdia about unsustainable costs → Medical intervention coming, team dynamic shift
- Isaiah Bennett memorial context → Tess's investigation into police cover-up, father's complicity
- Go Squad protects both protesters AND police → Moral complexity, no simple heroes/villains framework
