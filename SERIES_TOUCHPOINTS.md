# Go Squad Series: Big Picture Touchpoints (Books 1-8)

**Using TTRPG methodology to guide the complete series arc**

**Core Theme:** You don't have to be fixed to be worthy

**Structural Arc:** CBT approach failing (Books 1-4) → Turning point (Book 5) → DBT approach succeeding (Books 6-8)

---

## The Therapeutic Framework

### CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) - Books 1-4
**Core belief:** If I control outcomes perfectly, I'll be okay
**Pattern:** Identify problem → Apply solution → Control result
**Why it fails:** Reality is uncontrollable; perfectionism is unsustainable

### DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) - Books 5-8
**Core belief:** I can hold contradictions and still act
**Pattern:** Accept reality → Tolerate distress → Act from values (not outcomes)
**Why it succeeds:** Both/and thinking enables functioning despite chaos

---

## Series Touchpoint Map

### BOOK 1: AVOIDANCE → FORCED ACTION ✅ COMPLETE
**CBT Pattern:** Ahdia avoids life (depression, isolation)
**Forced Break:** Brother shot, must act
**Resolution:** Raspberry reveal - choosing connection over isolation

| Touchpoint | Event | CBT Lesson |
|------------|-------|------------|
| A | Firas shot, bleeds in bathroom | Can't avoid reality forever |
| B | Warehouse rescue, RPG fired | Control is illusion |
| C | Hyper Seed bonds with Ahdia | Powers come with cost |
| D | Secret training, helping team | Still trying to control from shadows |
| E | Frozen raspberry reveal | Choosing connection (first crack in isolation) |

**Baseline:** 100% → 90%
**Ending State:** Revealed, connected, but still believes she can control everything

---

### BOOK 2: SACRIFICE EVERYTHING → WIN THROUGH VULNERABILITY ✅ TTRPG COMPLETE
**CBT Pattern:** If I sacrifice enough, I can save everyone
**Why it fails:** Unsustainable; evidence doesn't matter; fear manipulates perception

| Touchpoint | Event | CBT Lesson |
|------------|-------|------------|
| A | Isaiah riot - saves 23, loses 16 | Perfect execution still has losses |
| B | Global vigilantism begins | Escalating sacrifice doesn't scale |
| C | Ruth/Ryu discover truth | Lies destroy trust even when "protecting" |
| D | Ben leaks evidence | Truth alone insufficient against fear |
| E | Kain wins despite perfect evidence | CBT control completely fails |
| F | Prime reveal | This timeline is already a compromise |

**Baseline:** 90% → 0.7% (CRITICAL)
**Ending State:** Powers burned out, evidence meaningless, Kain president, team fractured

---

### BOOK 3: CONFIDENCE → INCOMPREHENSIBLE CHALLENGE → STRANDED ✅ BEATS COMPLETE
**CBT Pattern:** Now I understand, I can handle it
**Why it fails:** Some challenges exceed comprehension; acceptance required

| Touchpoint | Event | CBT Lesson |
|------------|-------|------------|
| A | Diana burns out Ahdia's powers | Can't control being powerless |
| B | Kain seizes CADENS | Institutions fail |
| C | Bellatrix arrives on Earth | Enemy beyond comprehension |
| D | Diana shares iteration stories | Perfection impossible across ALL timelines |
| E | FAERIS drones abandon team | Even allies have limits |
| F | Ahdia stranded in The Between | Complete loss of control |

**Baseline:** 0.7% (cannot use powers)
**Ending State:** Ahdia in dimensional prison, team assumes she's dead, Bellatrix consolidating

---

### BOOK 4: PSYCHOLOGICAL COLLAPSE → GUERRILLA RESISTANCE → DESPERATE SURVIVAL ✅ BEATS IN PROGRESS
**CBT Pattern:** Keep fighting, keep controlling what we can
**Why it fails:** Scattered, isolated, grief overwhelming

**Structure:** Four braided timelines converging at F (Chapter 31)
- **Odd chapters:** Earth POV (Ruth + Korede + Antagonist pressure)
- **Even chapters:** The Between POV (Ahdia)
- **Chapter 31:** Convergence (all timelines collide)
- **Chapters 32-35:** Aftermath (Diana's transcendence, fallout)

#### TIMELINE 1: THE BETWEEN (Ahdia)
| Touchpoint | Event | CBT Lesson |
|------------|-------|------------|
| C | Ahdia meets AR-Ryu in The Between | Connection in isolation |
| C' | AR-Ryu evolves from tool to companion | Can't control what you come to love |
| D | AR-Ryu's battery failing, upload plan | Loss beyond recovery looms |
| D' | Suzie arrives, alliance forms | Forced to trust stranger |
| E | Suzie ejects Ahdia via harpoon toward rift | Forced to receive help (can't refuse) |
| F | Crosses rift; AR-Ryu dies; lands on Earth | Bittersweet arrival—saved but grieving |

#### TIMELINE 2: RUTH'S QUEST (Ruth, Tess, Diana, Ryu)
| Touchpoint | Event | CBT Lesson |
|------------|-------|------------|
| A' | Signal detected; Korede refuses to help | Can't control allies' priorities |
| B' | Coalition goes rogue; Jericho offers to be inside man | Control through allies—but who controls whom? |
| C' | Journey to CADENS HQ; Jericho provides access | Dependence on unverified ally |
| D' | Setback—security tightens, nearly caught | Loss of momentum |
| E' | Korede arrives with forces | Forced to receive help (can't refuse) |
| F | Reach Mother FAERIS; rift opens | Convergence—success with hidden cost |

#### TIMELINE 3: KOREDE'S FRONT (Korede, Ben, Victor, Leah)
| Touchpoint | Event | CBT Lesson |
|------------|-------|------------|
| A'' | Clone army + Eidolon assault begins | Can't control enemy's moves |
| B'' | Korede refuses Ruth—must defend civilians | Can't serve two priorities |
| C'' | Fighting retreat; moral injury killing clone avatars | Violence has cost even when necessary |
| D'' | Position deteriorating, overwhelmed | Can't control tide of war |
| E'' | **Ben's sacrifice**—holds line so Korede can leave | Forced to accept Ben's choice |
| F | Arrives at CADENS; kaiju turn tide | Victory through convergence |

#### TIMELINE 4: ANTAGONIST (Bellatrix, Jericho, Eidolon)
| Touchpoint | Event | Hidden Layer |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| A''' | Excavation begins; clone army deployed | Jericho positioned at Mother FAERIS |
| B''' | Bellatrix accelerates timeline | Jericho feeding intel to Ruth |
| C''' | Eidolon embodied, leads assault | Jericho prepares escape |
| D''' | Excavation nearly complete | Jericho ready to betray everyone |
| E''' | Go Squad assault disrupts plans | Jericho "helps" heroes—all according to plan |
| F | Rift opens; Jericho "falls" with Mother FAERIS | Perfect escape executed |

#### CONVERGENCE (Chapter 31)
All four timelines collide at CADENS HQ:
1. Ruth's team reaches Mother FAERIS
2. Korede's forces assault perimeter
3. Jericho activates rift—4-minute window
4. Ahdia crosses through (AR-Ryu dies mid-crossing)
5. Suzie/Pio crash through behind her
6. Kaiju pack follows, attacks clone army
7. Jericho's "accident"—falls into rift with Mother FAERIS
8. Rift seals; Eidolon retreats

#### THE TWO "DEATHS"
| Character | Appears to Die | Actually | Book 5 Reveal |
|-----------|---------------|----------|---------------|
| **Jericho** | Falls into rift "heroically" | Escaped with Mother FAERIS | Horror—villain alive, has built empire |
| **Ben** | Holds line against clone army | Survived somehow | Catharsis—hero alive, Suzie gets him back |

**Baseline:** Powers return on Earth, baseline still critical

**Ending State:**
- Ahdia back but grieving AR-Ryu
- Diana transcended (cosmic entity)
- Ben "dead" (actually alive—Book 5)
- Jericho "dead" (actually escaped with Mother FAERIS—Book 5)
- Eidolon retreated (building Rogue's Gallery)
- Suzie + Pio on Earth
- Kaiju resolved (Diana's transcendence)
- Team reunited but broken

**Key Revelations:**
- AR-Ryu's last words: "Tell him I loved her. Tell them about Iteration 3."
- Only Ahdia remembers The Between—no proof, just memory
- Diana's transcendence = payment for Geneva iterations
- Jericho was the hidden mastermind all along (revealed Book 5)

**Full details:** See `story_bibles/book 4/BOOK4_BRAIDED_TOUCHPOINTS.md`

### BOOK 5: TURNING POINT - DBT INTRODUCTION 📝 PLANNING
**The Shift:** CBT has definitively failed. New approach required.

**Core Question:** How do you function when control is impossible?

**Book 4 Reveals Land:**
- **Jericho reveal:** Evidence emerges he controlled Eidolon all along; "died" heroically but actually escaped with Mother FAERIS to The Between; team realizes they mourned their enemy
- **Ben reveal:** Returns alive after presumed death; Suzie's reunion; catharsis vs Jericho horror
- **Eidolon:** Building Rogue's Gallery in The Between; Jericho alliance begins

| Touchpoint | Event | DBT Introduction |
|------------|-------|------------------|
| A | Processing Book 4 losses + Jericho/Ben reveals | **Distress tolerance**: Sit with grief AND betrayal without fixing it |
| B | The Collector appears | **Radical acceptance**: Easy salvation offered, must refuse |
| C | Firas consciousness discovery | **Both/and**: Dead AND not dead, lost AND findable |
| D | Bellatrix confrontation | **Interpersonal effectiveness**: Negotiate with enemy |
| E | Team learns to function broken | **Emotion regulation**: Act from values, not outcomes |
| F | First successful DBT action | Stalemate achieved through acceptance, not control |

**Key Arc:** Team learns that "functioning while broken" IS the goal, not "getting fixed"

**Firas Thread Begins:**
- Discovery that Firas was displaced, not killed
- Consciousness exists somewhere in dimensional space
- No Hyper Seed = uncontrolled displacement
- His sacrifice was unnecessary (Ahdia was safe)
- The search begins

**Diana Thread:**
- Cosmic Diana occasionally appears in visions
- Open question: Is she still "good"? Becoming like Bellatrix?
- Can she help find Firas?

**THE COLLECTOR (Book 5 Antagonist):**
- Type III being obsessed with preserving "primitive" species
- Offers to "save" humanity by putting them in cosmic zoo/preserve
- Beautiful habitats, no freedom - gilded cage
- "Your species is dying - let me preserve you properly"
- **The Easy Way Out:**
  - Some humans WANT this (easier than fighting)
  - Temptation: Accept preservation vs struggle to save selves
  - DBT lesson: Accept help without losing autonomy
- **Why Team Refuses:**
  - Preservation ≠ life
  - Being saved ≠ saving yourself
  - Comfort without agency isn't worth
- **Resolution:** Collector withdraws offer, disappointed but not hostile
  - "You choose suffering over safety. Fascinating."
  - May return if humanity proves itself

---

### BOOK 6: DBT APPROACH - RADICAL ACCEPTANCE 📝 PLANNING
**Core Practice:** Accept reality as it is, not as we wish it were

| Touchpoint | Event | DBT Lesson |
|------------|-------|------------|
| A | Bellatrix's history revealed | Understanding enemy ≠ excusing enemy |
| B | Mother FAERIS awakened | Accepting institutional harm AND working with institution |
| C | Ahdia's designed singularity truth | Accepting artificial origins, asserting agency anyway |
| D | The Predecessor appears | Universe actively hostile AND we fight anyway |
| E | Firas located (dimensional space) | Found AND unreachable (yet) |
| F | First Bellatrix negotiation | Working with enemy because reality requires it |

**Key Arc:** "I accept that this is how things are. Now what do I do?"

**Bellatrix Development:**
- Reveal she's Ahdia/Firas's biological mother (clone avatar)
- "Love infection" - Type IV beings eliminated emotion, she caught it
- Watching children to understand her own transformation
- Beginning to question her mission

**THE PREDECESSOR (Book 6-7 Antagonist):**
- Previous Type 0 species that failed Bellatrix's test millennia ago
- Now cyborgs/AI - tried to "fix" themselves, became machines
- Sabotaging humanity's chance to succeed where they failed
- "If we couldn't achieve utopia, no one should get the chance"

**Their Motivation:**
- Jealousy: Watched other species get tested after their failure
- Bitterness: Broke themselves trying to pass the test
- Nihilism: If perfection is impossible, why let anyone try?
- "We did everything right and still failed. You don't deserve to succeed."

**Their Methods:**
- Sabotaging Earth's remaining resources
- Interfering with evacuation planning
- Attacking dimensional research (prevent finding Firas)
- Possibly what's actually killing Earth (not just Kain)

**Thematic Function:**
- Shows what happens when you CAN'T accept brokenness
- "If I can't be fixed, no one deserves to be" = toxic response to failure
- Challenge: Can Ahdia succeed where they failed?
- They're a warning, not just enemies

**Connection to Designed Singularities:**
- Did Type VI create designed singularities BECAUSE Predecessor failed?
- Are Ahdia/Firas the "fix" for what went wrong?
- Predecessor hates them specifically: "We were tested fairly. You were given advantages."

### BOOK 7: DBT APPROACH - BOTH/AND MASTERY 📝 PLANNING
**Core Practice:** Hold contradictions without collapsing into either/or

| Touchpoint | Event | DBT Lesson |
|------------|-------|------------|
| A | Bellatrix redemption attempt | Enemy AND mother AND victim AND perpetrator |
| B | Firas rescue operation | Success AND permanent change (he won't be same) |
| C | Earth declared unsalvageable | Accept loss AND act anyway |
| D | Predecessor final assault | Enemy's despair AND your hope, both valid |
| E | Bellatrix finally understands love | Too late AND still meaningful |
| F | Deceleration problem revealed | Designed for purpose AND choosing to accept it |

**Key Arc:** "Both things are true. I can hold them both."

**Firas Return:**
- Consciousness retrieved but changed
- Experienced dimensional existence, perspective altered
- Both the brother Ahdia knew AND someone new
- His sacrifice was unnecessary - processing that truth

**Bellatrix Climax:**
- Finally understands motherhood and love
- Realizes damage she's caused
- Redemption? Or tragic realization too late?
- Chooses to protect children, help migration

**PREDECESSOR'S FINAL ASSAULT:**
- Last attempt to stop humanity's escape
- Attack on vessel construction / launch preparation
- "If we can't leave, neither can you"
- Must be defeated for migration to proceed

**Predecessor Resolution:**
- **Option A:** Destroyed in final battle (tragic - they chose destruction)
- **Option B:** Witness humanity's choice, withdraw in confusion
  - "You're broken AND you're still going. How?"
  - Can't compute acceptance they never learned
- **Option C:** One Predecessor individual defects, helps humanity
  - "I'm tired of being bitter. Show me your way."
  - Represents hope even for the broken who broke themselves

**EIDOLON'S EVOLUTION (Book 7):**
- Embodiment has fully changed Eidolon
- No longer pure fear entity - experiencing contradiction
- Questioning Bellatrix's orders
- When Bellatrix begins redemption, Eidolon watches
- **The Choice:** Amplify fear to doom migration OR stand down
- Eidolon chooses NOT to amplify
- "I was made to spread terror. I choose not to."
- Fear entity learns hope - ultimate both/and

**NEW EARTH MIGRATION:**
- Kain's exploitation + Bellatrix's war + Predecessor sabotage = Earth beyond repair
- Environmental collapse, resource depletion, infrastructure destroyed
- Humanity must migrate to New Earth (habitable planet identified)
- Near-lightspeed vessel constructed (Type IV/VI technology + Mother FAERIS)

**THE DECELERATION PROBLEM:**
- Real physics: Achieving near-lightspeed is "easy" (enough energy + time)
- Stopping is the impossibility - equal energy required to decelerate
- No conventional technology can solve this
- Vessel would overshoot New Earth, drift forever

**WHY DESIGNED SINGULARITIES EXIST:**
- Type VI created Ahdia and Firas specifically for this
- Their temporal/dimensional manipulation can affect spacetime
- They can create controlled deceleration field around vessel
- **This is their designed purpose** - not utopia testing, not observation
- Bellatrix's "experiment" was actually preparation
- Predecessor failed because they had no designed singularities

**THE CHOICE:**
- Ahdia/Firas can refuse (reject instrumentalization)
- OR accept purpose AND choose it freely (both/and)
- "I wasn't made for this. But I choose to do it anyway."
- Worth comes from choosing, not from being designed

---

### BOOK 8: DBT APPROACH - WORTH WITHOUT FIXING 📝 PLANNING
**Core Practice:** "You don't have to be fixed to be worthy"

| Touchpoint | Event | DBT Lesson |
|------------|-------|------------|
| A | Migration vessel launches | Leaving broken Earth AND carrying hope |
| B | Diana returns from cosmic space | Changed AND herself (transcendence ≠ corruption) |
| C | Bellatrix joins deceleration effort | Broken AND protective AND capable |
| D | Near-lightspeed achieved | Point of no return AND point of beginning |
| E | Deceleration begins | Choosing purpose AND making it your own |
| F | New Earth arrival | Worth through action, not design |

**Key Arc:** "I'm not your solution. I'm a person making my own choices."

**THE DECELERATION (Series Climax):**
- Vessel at near-lightspeed, approaching New Earth system
- Ahdia and Firas working together (first time since Book 1)
- Their temporal/dimensional powers create spacetime distortion field
- Deceleration proceeding - costly but sustainable with shared load
- Diana assists from cosmic space (higher-dimensional anchor)

**THE CRISIS:**
- Something goes wrong - loss of stability, field collapsing
- One sibling must absorb full load or everyone dies
- **Echo of Book 1:** Firas moves to sacrifice himself again
- Ahdia tries to take his place - refuses to lose him twice
- They struggle, both trying to save the other

**BELLATRIX'S SACRIFICE:**
- Bellatrix intervenes - pushes both children aside
- She's Type IV - her dimensional capacity exceeds theirs
- **The difference from Firas in Book 1:**
  - Firas didn't understand (thought Ahdia would die)
  - Bellatrix KNOWS her children will survive without her
  - She chooses this with full knowledge
  - Not protecting them from danger - giving them life she finally values
- "I finally understand what I made. Let me do this one thing right."

**THE INVERSION:**
- Book 1: Child "dies" saving sibling (unnecessary sacrifice from misunderstanding)
- Book 8: Mother dies saving children (chosen sacrifice from understanding)
- Firas's sacrifice was love without comprehension
- Bellatrix's sacrifice is love finally comprehended

**BELLATRIX'S LAST MOMENTS:**
- Absorbing the full deceleration load
- Type IV being pushed beyond limits
- For the first time: not observing humanity, not testing them
- Being human - a mother saving her children
- "This is what love is. I understand now."
- Dissolves/transcends/dies (nature of Type IV death TBD)

**THE COST:**
- Bellatrix: Gone (redemption through sacrifice, not absolution)
- Ahdia/Firas: Alive, baseline damaged but recovering
- They wanted to save her - couldn't
- Must live with being saved by the mother who tortured them
- Both/and: Grateful AND grieving AND angry AND at peace

**Series Resolution:**
- **Bellatrix:** Finally understood love, died for it (not absolution - consequences remain)
- **Diana:** Returns, proves transcendence doesn't require corruption, witnesses mother's choice
- **Firas:** Saved twice by family members, processing survivor's guilt AND gratitude
- **Ahdia:** Lost mother she never had AND received mother's ultimate gift
- **Team:** On vessel, carrying weight of everything, starting over
- **Humanity:** Survivors begin again, unaware of what it cost

**Final Image:**
- New Earth in viewport
- Ahdia and Firas, exhausted, holding each other
- Where Bellatrix was: empty space, or light, or nothing
- Behind them: everyone who survived
- Ahead: a world they didn't break yet
- They didn't have to be fixed. They just had to keep choosing.
- And someone who broke them... chose too.

## The New Earth Migration Arc (Books 7-8)

### The Physics Problem

**Why Deceleration is Impossible:**
- At near-lightspeed, relativistic mass increases dramatically
- Slowing requires energy equal to what accelerated you
- Conventional propulsion can't generate enough thrust
- You'd need to carry fuel to slow the fuel that slows you (exponential problem)
- Without solution: vessel overshoots target, drifts forever, everyone dies

**Real-World Proposals (All Insufficient):**
- Magnetic sails (too slow)
- Laser deceleration from destination (requires civilization already there)
- Antimatter (can't produce/store enough)
- Generation ships (don't solve deceleration, just delay the problem)

### Why Designed Singularities Solve It

**Temporal/Dimensional Manipulation:**
- Ahdia/Firas can affect spacetime itself, not just objects within it
- Create localized field where physics operates differently
- Essentially: make the universe "agree" the ship is slower
- Not thrust-based deceleration - reality manipulation

**The Cost:**
- Massive baseline burn (cellular degradation)
- Extended use over deceleration period (weeks? months?)
- Would kill one person alone
- Together, they share the load - survivable but devastating
- Diana's cosmic perspective helps stabilize the field
- Bellatrix's Type IV knowledge guides the process

### Thematic Resonance

**"You don't have to be fixed to be worthy":**
- They're literally broken (baseline critical) AND saving humanity
- Not fixed, never will be fixed, still worthy

**Both/And Thinking:**
- Designed for purpose AND choosing it freely
- Resentful of being used AND grateful to help
- Leaving home (grief) AND finding new one (hope)

**The Ultimate CBT→DBT Payoff:**
- CBT: "If I control everything perfectly, I can save everyone"
- Reality: Can't control everything, can't save everyone
- DBT: "Accept reality AND act from values"
- They accept they were designed, accept Earth is lost, accept the cost
- AND they choose to act anyway

### Who Gets on the Vessel?

**Questions to Resolve:**
- How many humans survive? (Millions? Thousands?)
- Selection process? (Lottery? Merit? First-come?)
- Who stays behind? (Volunteers? Criminals? The sick?)
- Does Kain try to take control of vessel?
- Does anyone choose to die on Earth rather than leave?

**Go Squad Status:**
- All on vessel (they're essential personnel)
- Ruth: Ship's medical lead
- Ryu: Technical systems
- Tess: Communications/tech
- Korede: Resistance leader turned logistics
- Ben/Victor/Leah: Security and community organization
- Mother FAERIS: Integrated into vessel systems?

## Cross-Series Threads

### Ahdia's Baseline Progression

**See Also:** `/story_bibles/universe/CYCLIC_UNIVERSE_COSMOLOGY.md` for cyclic time mechanics

| Book | Start | End | Cause |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| 1 | 100% | 90% | Training, warehouse, police ambush |
| 2 | 90% | 0.7% | Global vigilantism, Election Night fusion reactor sacrifice (10+ min freeze) |
| 3 | 0.7% | 0.7% | Powers critically damaged, blocked further in The Between |
| 4 | 0.7% | ~5% | Diana's transcendence plants seed: glimpse of cyclic time mechanics |
| 5-6 | ~5% | ~15% | Slow recovery, DBT approach, working toward understanding |
| 7-8 | ~15% | 100% | Micro-cycling mastery: localized temporal loops restore full power |

**Power Restoration Mechanism (Books 7-8):**
- Diana's transcendence gift = glimpse of the truth of time
- Time travel only goes forward, through universal death/rebirth
- "Rewinding" = cycling forward until reality loops
- **Micro-cycling:** Same physics at smaller scale
- Ahdia learns to cycle just her powers through localized temporal loop
- Powers complete micro-death/rebirth, returning to prior state
- EARNED through understanding, not given as gift

### Firas Arc
| Book | Status | Knowledge |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Alive → "Dead" | Sacrifices self to stop Ahdia's transformation |
| 2-4 | Assumed dead | Team grieves, Ahdia carries guilt |
| 5 | Discovery | Displaced, not dead; consciousness exists |
| 6 | Located | Found in dimensional space, unreachable |
| 7 | Rescued | Returns changed, processes unnecessary sacrifice |
| 8 | Transformed | New role, still family, both/and resolution |

### Bellatrix Arc
| Book | Status | Understanding |
|------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Waiting at threshold | Unknown entity |
| 2 | Geneva revealed as clone | Watching through avatar |
| 3 | Arrives on Earth | Building fear army, clone avatars |
| 4 | Consolidating power | Enemy at full strength |
| 5 | First negotiations | Learning she's their mother |
| 6 | History revealed | Type IV "love infection" explained |
| 7 | Helps migration | Finally understands motherhood |
| 8 | **Sacrifices herself** | Dies saving children - love finally comprehended |

**Bellatrix's Sacrifice - The Book 1 Inversion:**
- Book 1: Firas sacrifices himself from misunderstanding (thought Ahdia would die)
- Book 8: Bellatrix sacrifices herself from understanding (knows children will live)
- She doesn't get absolution - consequences of her actions remain
- But she finally becomes what she studied: human, loving, mortal

### Diana Arc
| Book | Status | Role |
|------|--------|------|
| 1-2 | Hidden | Probability tilting from shadows |
| 3 | Revealed | "Aunt Diana," iteration stories revealed, guides Ahdia |
| 4 | Transcends | Sacrifices humanity to save Earth |
| 5-7 | Cosmic | Appears in visions, open question about corruption |
| 8 | Returns | Proves transcendence ≠ corruption, rejoins family |

### FAERIS Arc
| Book | Autonomy | Key Event |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | 10% | Supporting team |
| 2 | 50% | First autonomous decision (Exile Island broadcast) |
| 3 | Conflicted | Drones abandon team, Mother exploited |
| 4 | Fractured | Tess's FAERIS stays loyal (why?) |
| 5 | Awakening | Mother FAERIS awakened |
| 6-8 | Full autonomy | Ally by choice, not programming |

## TTRPG Session Planning

### How to Use Touchpoints

Each touchpoint represents a **major story beat** that should be developed through TTRPG sessions:

1. **Define the scene context** (location, characters, stakes)
2. **Identify the therapeutic lesson** (what CBT/DBT concept is demonstrated?)
3. **Roll for complications** (chaos system introduces unexpected elements)
4. **Generate beats** (5-7 story moments per touchpoint)
5. **Track consequences** (what changes as result of this touchpoint?)

### Dice System for Touchpoints

**Touchpoint Success Roll (d10):**
- 1-3: Touchpoint achieved with major complication
- 4-6: Touchpoint achieved with minor complication
- 7-9: Touchpoint achieved cleanly
- 10: Touchpoint achieved with unexpected bonus

**Chaos Injection (d6 per touchpoint):**
- 1: Character death/permanent loss
- 2: Betrayal or revelation
- 3: Rescue or unexpected ally
- 4: Power cost/baseline burn
- 5: Relationship shift
- 6: No chaos (rare)

## Thematic Throughlines

### "You Don't Have to Be Fixed to Be Worthy"
**Book 1:** Ahdia worthy despite depression
**Book 2:** Team worthy despite failures
**Book 3:** Diana worthy despite 5 failed iterations
**Book 4:** Resistance worthy despite losses
**Book 5:** Functioning broken IS the goal
**Book 6:** Accepting reality without being destroyed
**Book 7:** Holding contradictions without collapse
**Book 8:** Rejecting instrumentalization, choosing own worth

### Both/And Thinking Progression
**Books 1-4 (CBT):** Either/or thinking dominates
- Win OR lose
- Save everyone OR fail
- Control OR chaos

**Books 5-8 (DBT):** Both/and thinking emerges
- Win AND lose (bittersweet victories)
- Save some AND lose others (triage)
- Accept chaos AND act anyway (radical acceptance)

---

## Antagonist Progression

### Primary Antagonists by Book

| Book | Primary Antagonist | Secondary Threats |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Kain (local threat) | Police, institutional corruption |
| 2 | Eidolon + Kain (political) | TRIOMF network, fear manipulation, Jericho (hidden) |
| 3 | Bellatrix (cosmic arrival) | Clone avatar army, FAERIS abandonment, Jericho (hidden) |
| 4 | Bellatrix + Eidolon (excavation) | Clone army, Jericho (hidden mastermind) |
| 5 | **Jericho (revealed)** + Rogue's Gallery | The Collector, Bellatrix (negotiating) |
| 6 | **The Predecessor** | Jericho's Between empire, Bellatrix (shifting) |
| 7 | **Predecessor (final assault)** | Jericho + Rogue's Gallery, time pressure |
| 8 | Deceleration crisis | Bellatrix (redemption), legacy of choices |

### Antagonist Arcs

**Kain:**
- Books 1-4: Escalating threat (Mayor → President → Puppet of Bellatrix?)
- Books 5+: Diminished? Dead? Irrelevant once cosmic stakes arrive?
- Resolution needed: Does he get on vessel? Justice? Abandoned on dying Earth?

**Jericho (Dr. Doom analog):**
- Books 1-4: Hidden mastermind (CADENS CSO, Eidolon controller, Kain-Bellatrix connector)
- Book 4: "Dies" heroically, actually escapes to The Between with Mother FAERIS
- Book 5: Revealed as villain; building empire in The Between ruins ("Latveria")
- Books 5-8: Leads Rogue's Gallery with Eidolon; "eliminate equals" philosophy
- Uses cosmic radio archaeology to know about Helminth, Conclave, cosmic threats
- Eventual confrontation with Ahdia inevitable
- No redemption arc—pure ego-driven sociopath

**Eidolon:**
- Books 2-4: Pure function (fear amplification under Jericho's control)
- Book 4: Embodied in human avatar; experiences war; concludes "humanity is disease"
- Book 4 end: Retreats, begins building Rogue's Gallery
- Book 5-6: Alliance with Jericho in The Between (uneasy—both planning betrayal)
- Book 7: Chooses not to amplify? Or doubles down on extinction?
