# FAERIS Drones

## Overview

**FAERIS** - **Field-Adaptive Entanglement Reconnaissance and Infiltration System**

Advanced surveillance and translocation technology managed by CADENS

**Primary Function:** Monitoring cataclysmic events and cosmic anomalies

**Managed By:** Dr. Shiba Ryu

**Named By:** Dr. Shiba Ryu (technical designation reflecting dual capabilities)

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Picosecond Frame Recording

**Technical Specs:**
- Captures events at picosecond (trillionth of a second) intervals
- Can record frozen time events
- Gravity anomaly detection enables temporal event capture
- Creates frame-by-frame analysis of events happening in stopped time

**Applications:**
- Monitoring Temporalist activity
- Recording cataclysm events
- Analyzing cosmic phenomena
- Evidence collection for CADENS analysis

**Limitations:**
- Requires cataclysm ore to power
- Finite resource (costly to operate)
- Cannot operate inside time bubbles (only observe from outside)

### 2. Advanced Surveillance

**Capabilities:**
- Stealth monitoring (difficult to detect)
- Multi-spectrum observation
- Long-range tracking
- Autonomous operation
- Network coordination with other FAERIS units

**Typical Deployment:**
- Monitoring persons of interest
- Tracking cosmic artifacts (Hyper Seed, etc.)
- Observing cataclysm events as they unfold
- Perimeter security for CADENS operations

### 3. Translocation Technology

**Function:** FAERIS drones serve as targeting beacons for quantum entanglement teleportation

**The "Painting" Process:**
- Drone emits targeting signal toward subject
- Visual effect: Beam of light, scanning pattern
- Marks quantum signature of target
- Enables translocation of both drone and painted subject

**Teleportation Mechanics:**

**NOT Star Trek-Style Copy/Paste:**
- Same particles, not copies
- No "original vs copy" existential question
- Continuity of consciousness maintained throughout
- Subject is definitively the same person

**Quantum Entanglement Method:**
- Space folding/collapsing between locations
- Distance becomes instantaneously meaningless
- Reality reorganizes around subject
- Subject didn't move to destination—destination moved to subject
- Physics bends, not person replaced

**Experience of Being Translocated:**

**Physical Sensation:**
- Extreme disorientation
- Being in two places simultaneously (briefly)
- Every particle "knowing" it should be elsewhere
- Body's relationship to space violated
- Profound wrongness (not motion, reality editing)

**Psychological Impact:**
- Worse than motion sickness (no motion occurred)
- "Here" and "there" briefly meaningless
- Space inverted around you
- Distance lied about where you were
- Certainty of continuity but violation of spatial logic

**Recovery:**
- Disorientation fades within seconds to minutes
- No lasting physical damage
- Some subjects experience nausea
- Repeated exposure doesn't reduce disorientation (brain can't adapt to physics violation)

**Range:**
- Unknown maximum distance
- Requires line-of-sight or prior knowledge of destination
- Both drone and subject translocate together

## Resource Requirements

### Cataclysm Ore

**Function:** Powers FAERIS advanced capabilities (especially picosecond recording and translocation)

**Source:** Recovered from cataclysm event sites

**Limitation:** Finite supply
- CADENS has limited stockpile
- Each use depletes resource
- Must be strategic about deployment
- Training/testing uses are not economical
- Director Bourn strictly controls ore expenditure

**Strategic Impact:**
- CADENS cannot use FAERIS casually
- Each translocation/recording session must be justified
- Cannot run continuous training programs for Temporalists
- Forces selective intervention rather than constant monitoring

---

## Operational Use by CADENS

### Monitoring Ahdia Bacchus

**Timeline:**
- Warehouse incident: FAERIS drones present, recorded bonding
- Training period: Surveillance of apartment break-ins, power experiments
- Police ambush: Recorded secret assistance to Go Squad
- Frozen reveal: Drone outside time bubble, able to communicate

**Strategic Decisions:**
- Overseer authorized monitoring despite ore cost
- Justified by Hyper Seed/Temporalist significance
- Surveillance provided intel for recruitment decision
- Drone intervention at academy = commitment to contact

### Typical CADENS Deployment

**High-Priority Targets:**
- Cosmic artifact tracking (Hyper Seed, Hyper Cube, etc.)
- Known enhanced individuals
- Cataclysm event sites
- Persons of interest (like Kain)

**Operational Protocols:**
- Autonomous surveillance mode (minimal ore use)
- Active recording only when necessary (high ore cost)
- Translocation reserved for critical extractions/interventions
- Network coordination for coverage

## Story Function

### Narrative Purposes

**1. CADENS Omniscience:**
- Establishes that CADENS can monitor cosmic events
- Shows their technological sophistication
- Creates sense of "they're always watching"
- Removes privacy as protection for protagonists

**2. Reframing Device:**
- Allows showing previous events from surveillance perspective
- Provides technical/analytical view of Ahdia's powers
- Bridges street-level action to institutional response

**3. Plot Enabler:**
- Translocation allows instant CADENS intervention
- Surveillance footage serves as evidence/exposition
- Creates vulnerability (Ahdia can be found/extracted)

**4. Thematic Element:**
- Surveillance state metaphor
- Privacy vs. security tension
- Individual autonomy vs. institutional control
- Technology as double-edged sword

## Limitations & Vulnerabilities

### What FAERIS Cannot Do

**Cannot:**
- Operate inside time bubbles (must observe from outside edge)
- Prevent events, only monitor
- Replace human judgment (requires operator analysis)
- Function indefinitely (ore limitations)
- Predict future, only record present/past
- Capture internal thoughts/emotions (only external actions)

**Vulnerable To:**
- Destruction by sufficient force
- Electromagnetic interference (possibly)
- Cosmic entities (Intermediary could likely disable)
- Cataclysm ore depletion (renders advanced features unusable)

### Ethical Concerns

**Surveillance Overreach:**
- Monitors individuals without consent
- Privacy invasion justified by "greater good"
- Potential for abuse by CADENS
- No oversight on deployment decisions

**Translocation Consent:**
- Can forcibly relocate individuals
- Subject has no choice once "painted"
- Physically violating (extreme disorientation)
- Potential for kidnapping/detention

**Resource Hoarding:**
- CADENS controls cataclysm ore exclusively
- Technology unavailable to others
- Power concentrated in shadow organization
- No democratic accountability

## Future Development

### Potential Story Beats

**Book 1:**
- Introduced through surveillance of Ahdia
- Translocation demonstrated at academy
- Establishes CADENS technological edge

**Book 2-3:**
- Ahdia learns to detect FAERIS drones
- Possible theft/hacking of FAERIS tech by Go Squad
- Ore depletion becomes plot point
- Someone else gains translocation capability

**Book 4+:**
- FAERIS network compromised by Bellatrix
- Technology turned against CADENS

- Ethical reforms to surveillance protocols

### Open Questions

**Technical:**
- Can Temporalists detect FAERIS inside time bubbles?
- What happens if translocation interrupted mid-process?
- Can FAERIS paint multiple subjects simultaneously?
- Range limitations on translocation?

**Strategic:**
- How much cataclysm ore does CADENS have left?
- Who else knows about FAERIS technology?
- Has anyone reverse-engineered it?
- Are there other organizations with similar tech?

**Ethical:**
- Does CADENS need warrants for FAERIS surveillance?
- Who authorizes translocation of civilians?
- What are rules of engagement for FAERIS deployment?
- How is ore expenditure justified?

## Writing Guidelines

### When Writing FAERIS Scenes

**Do:**
- Emphasize disorientation of translocation
- Show resource cost considerations (ore depletion)
- Maintain surveillance creepiness (they're always watching)
- Use technical language through Ryu/CADENS operators
- Show limitations (can't do everything)

**Don't:**
- Make translocation casual or painless
- Forget ore cost (can't spam teleportation)
- Let FAERIS solve all problems (plot crutch)
- Ignore consent/ethical issues
- Make them undetectable (characters can notice)

### Voice/Description

**Technical (CADENS operators):**
- "FAERIS unit Seven-Alpha painting target"
- "Translocation sequence initiated"
- "Picosecond capture active, ore expenditure at 4%"

**Visceral (Subject experience):**
- "Space inverted around her"
- "Her particles screamed they were elsewhere"
- "Distance became a lie her body couldn't accept"

**Ahdia's perspective:**
- Casual observation of wrongness
- Pop culture comparison attempts (fails to match experience)
- Physical discomfort mixed with sarcasm
- "That was like teleportation in the movies, except if the movies made you want to puke for being too accurate about physics"
