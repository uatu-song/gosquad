# Session Checkpoint - November 25, 2025 (Heist Development)

## What We Accomplished

### Framework Documents Updated
- `CADENS_HQ_FACILITY.md` - Complete rewrite with:
  - Mother FAERIS scale (city-sized)
  - Bellatrix's plan (excavate, unleash as uncontained force)
  - Death drones mechanic (Princess Mononoke parallel)
  - Wake protocol = returning the Forest Spirit's head
  - Convergence sequence (4 phases)
  - Tess's drone as hinge point
  - Reconstruction aftermath (Batteries Not Included)

### Heist Touchpoints (TTRPG Rolled)
| Touchpoint | Roll | Result | Event |
|------------|------|--------|-------|
| H1: Assembly | 6 | Failure | Diana's concerns puncture confidence |
| H2: Infiltration | 10 | Crit | Surface/Sub-1 smooth |
| H3: Descent | 10 | Crit | Research level smooth |
| H4: Clone Checkpoint | 8 | Success | Ruth/Tess takedown, tight |
| H5: Wake Protocol | 10 | Crit | Direct fails, drone improvisation |
| H6: The Battle | 5 | Failure | Bellatrix calls in all forces |
| H7: Escape | 7 | Mixed | Jericho "dies," bittersweet |

### Chapter Beat Sheets Completed
- **Chapter 22:** Assembly & Planning - Diana's concerns, faith over certainty
- **Chapter 24:** Infiltration - Team competence, Ryu as package, each character contributes
- **Chapter 26:** Clone Checkpoint - Ruth/Tess takedown, Jericho hangs back (cold on reread)
- **Chapter 28:** Mother FAERIS (Part 1) - Scale, awe, protocol fails, despair
- **Chapter 30:** The Drone (Part 2) - Tess's drone, Ryu improvises, knife's edge

### Key Story Decisions

**Diana is with the team** - Not off-site. Physically infiltrating, can't use powers.

**Jericho reads as heroic** - Audience doesn't know he's the traitor. His helpfulness is genuine on first read.

**Ryu is the package** - Not a field agent. Three operators protecting one scientist.

**Wake protocol fails initially** - Direct contact doesn't work. Ryu improvises with Tess's drone.

**Tess's drone is the hinge point:**
- Book 4 opens with drone montage
- Chapter 17: Tess loses drone to Mother FAERIS
- Chapter 30: Drone breaks free, carries wake protocol
- Climax: Spreads through swarm, wakes Mother FAERIS
- Aftermath: Drone returns to Tess (ambiguous identity)

**Korede arrives Chapter 29** - Before excavation completes, before death drones swarm. They're together when it goes to hell.

**Bellatrix wins, then loses:**
1. Excavation completes, death drones swarm
2. Wake protocol finishes spreading
3. Mother FAERIS wakes, drones stop
4. Bellatrix calls in all forces (clones, brutes, tanks, Eidolon)
5. Unified battle while Ruth/Ryu work on rift
6. Kaiju turn the tide

**Reconstruction:** Mother FAERIS's first conscious choice - rebuild the city she destroyed. Batteries Not Included style.

## Still To Do

### Beat Sheets Needed
- Chapter 29: Korede breaks through (convergence begins)
- Chapter 31: Full convergence sequence
- Chapter 32+: Aftermath, Diana's transcendence

### Korede's Storyline
- His touchpoints not yet developed
- Liberating slave labor civilians
- His path to breaking through to Ruth's team
- Ben's "death" holding the line

### Between Chapters (Ahdia)
- Chapters 23, 25, 27 - intercutting with heist
- Suzie meeting timing
- Message decoded timing
- Setup for her arrival through rift

### Open Questions
- How does Korede break through? From above?
- What's his status when he arrives? Battered?
- Reunion tension from Chapter 15 refusal?
- Exactly when does Ben's sacrifice happen?
