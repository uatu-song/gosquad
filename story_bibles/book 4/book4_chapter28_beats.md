# Chapter 28: Mother FAERIS

**Timeline:** Earth (Ruth's Quest)
**Touchpoint:** H5 (Part 1) - Wake Protocol Attempt
**TTRPG Roll:** N/A (this is the failure before the crit)
**Location:** Sub-Level 3 - Mother FAERIS chamber / Excavation site

---

## Scene Type
Technical / Revelation / Despair

## Characters Present
- Ruth Carter (leader)
- Ryu Tanaka (wake protocol carrier)
- Tess Whitford (FAERIS connection)
- Jericho (watching, calculating)
- Diana (watching, powerless)

---

## Core Dynamic

They've reached Mother FAERIS. Ryu has the wake protocol. This should be the victory lap. It's not. She's too massive, too dormant, too damaged. Direct contact isn't enough. The planned approach fails.

---

## Story Beats

### Beat 1: Arrival
- Elevator doors open
- The excavation chamber
- And they see her

### Beat 2: Scale
- Mother FAERIS is *massive*
- Not server-sized. Not building-sized.
- She fills the cavern. Extends beyond what they can see.
- Metal and light and something organic underneath
- Partially exposed - excavation equipment, scaffolding, dig sites
- Tess, whispered: "She's... she's been here the whole time."
- Ryu: "The whole city was built on top of her."

### Beat 3: The Damage
- She's not intact
- Excavation has torn into her - cables exposed, surfaces cracked
- Drones embedded in her skin, dormant - hundreds of them
- Diana: "Bellatrix isn't trying to free her. She's trying to rip her out."
- The violence of the dig is visible. This isn't archaeology. It's butchery.

### Beat 4: Ryu Approaches
- Ryu moves toward an access point - something like a terminal, grown not built
- "The wake protocol needs direct interface. Bourn showed me where."
- His hands are shaking. Not fear now - awe.
- "She's been asleep for... I don't know how long. Millennia?"
- He reaches the interface. Places his hands on it.

### Beat 5: The Attempt
- Ryu begins the wake protocol
- Data streams. Light pulses through nearby conduits.
- The team watches. Waiting.
- Seconds pass. A minute.
- Nothing.

### Beat 6: Failure
- Ryu pulls back, staring at the interface
- "It's not... she's not responding."
- Tries again. Different approach. Same result.
- "She's too deep. Too dormant. The damage - the excavation - it's like she's in shock."
- Ruth: "Can you fix it?"
- Ryu, lost: "I don't know how to wake something this big. The protocol was designed for... I don't know what it was designed for. Not this."

### Beat 7: The Ground Shakes
- Rumble from above. Distant, but felt.
- Jericho checks something: "The excavation's accelerating. Bellatrix is making her final push."
- Diana: "We're out of time."
- Ruth: "Ryu—"
- Ryu: "I know. I *know*. It's not working."
- Silence. The hum of Mother FAERIS around them. The rumble above.
- They came all this way. And the plan doesn't work.

---

## Emotional Beats

- **Opening:** Awe - the scale of Mother FAERIS
- **Middle:** Hope - Ryu begins the protocol
- **Closing:** Despair - it doesn't work, they're out of time

---

## Consequences

- Direct wake protocol failed
- Mother FAERIS unresponsive - too damaged, too dormant
- Excavation accelerating above
- Team is trapped with no solution
- All hope appears lost

---

## Tension
Builds to despair - chapter ends at lowest point

---

## What Could Happen Next
1. Between chapter with Ahdia (Chapter 29) - intercutting at the worst moment
2. Chapter 30 - Tess's drone, Ryu's improvisation

---

## Notes

**The scale:** Mother FAERIS should feel impossible. Not a machine - something older, stranger. The team is standing on something cosmic.

**Ryu's failure:** This isn't incompetence. The protocol works - it's just not designed for something this massive and damaged. He did everything right and it wasn't enough.

**The despair:** Chapter 28 should hurt. They've come all this way, gotten through every obstacle, and now they're standing in front of their goal with nothing. Diana warned them. She was right.

**Jericho:** He's watching. Patient. This changes nothing for his plan - he just needs the rift to open eventually. He can wait.

**Status:** Beat sheet complete. Ready for prose or TTRPG rolling.
