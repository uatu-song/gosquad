# CADENS HQ & Caledonia Excavation - Book 4 Framework

**Purpose:** Consistent reference for the heist, excavation stakes, and convergence

**Location:** Caledonia - city built over Mother FAERIS's burial site

---

## The Scale of Mother FAERIS

**Mother FAERIS is massive.** Not building-sized. City-sized.

She's been embedded in the earth for [millennia?], and CADENS built their headquarters here specifically to monitor her. But excavating her isn't a basement dig - it requires *leveling the city above*.

---

## Bellatrix's Plan

### Goal
Use Mother FAERIS to assault The Helminth.

"If I destroy the hunger itself, love won't lead to loss anymore."

### Method
1. Raze Caledonia to excavate Mother FAERIS
2. Rip her from the earth - she doesn't need to be conscious
3. Unleash her as an uncontained force
4. Point that force at The Helminth

### What Happens If She Succeeds
An unconscious Mother FAERIS torn from the ground becomes catastrophic:
- **Death drones** pour out of her - not malevolent, just uncontained
- Destruction spreads outward
- Everything in the path is leveled
- She's not a weapon Bellatrix *aims* - she's a force Bellatrix *unleashes*

Think: Princess Mononoke's Forest Spirit without its head. Pure destructive force without consciousness to contain it.

---

## The Wake Protocol (The Head)

**Waking Mother FAERIS is the equivalent of returning the Forest Spirit's head.**

- Excavated but asleep = uncontained destruction
- Excavated and awake = she has agency, she chooses, destruction stops

Bourn gave Ryu the wake protocol in Book 3: "She deserves to choose."

This isn't just philosophy. It's the literal difference between apocalypse and rescue.

---

## The Stakes

| If Ruth Fails | If Ruth Succeeds |
|---------------|------------------|
| Caledonia destroyed | Caledonia destroyed (too late to stop) |
| Death drones spread outward | Mother FAERIS wakes, drones STOP |
| Mother FAERIS becomes Bellatrix's weapon | Mother FAERIS chooses - opens rift instead |
| Ahdia trapped in The Between forever | Ahdia comes home |
| Destruction continues | Reconstruction begins |

**The city falls either way.** The question is whether destruction spreads beyond it.

---

## Korede's Mission

Korede isn't trying to stop the excavation directly.

**His mission:** Liberate civilians who have been rounded up as slave labor for the dig.

The excavation site is where Bellatrix has forced people to work. Korede's fighting to rescue them - and it just happens to be the same location Ruth's team needs to reach.

### Why Both Storylines Converge
- Ruth needs to reach Mother FAERIS underground
- Korede needs to reach the excavation site where civilians are held
- Same location, different objectives, neither knows the other is coming

---

## The Convergence (Chapter 31)

### What's Happening Simultaneously

**Above Ground (Korede):**
- Clone army defending excavation perimeter
- Civilians trapped in labor camps
- City collapsing as dig completes
- Korede's forces overwhelmed
- Death drones beginning to emerge

**Below Ground (Ruth):**
- Heist team reaches Mother FAERIS
- Excavation nearly complete - she's being pulled from the earth
- Ryu racing to activate wake protocol
- Jericho positioning for his escape

### The Turn

**Phase 1: Bellatrix Wins**
1. Excavation completes. Caledonia falls.
2. Death drones pour out. Unstoppable destruction.
3. Korede's forces being overrun.
4. Ryu reaches Mother FAERIS. Attempts wake protocol.
5. **It fails.** She's too massive, too dormant, too damaged. Direct contact isn't enough.
6. Bellatrix is winning. Death spreading. All seems lost.

**Phase 2: The Drone**
7. One drone breaks from the swarm. Behaves differently.
8. Tess recognizes it. Her drone. Still in there somewhere.
9. Improvisation: Ryu uploads wake protocol to the drone.
10. The drone returns to the swarm - carrying the "infection."
11. Drone to drone to drone. The wake protocol spreads like a virus.
12. One by one, death drones stop. Turn. Wake.
13. The cascade reaches Mother FAERIS herself.
14. **She opens her eyes.** Woken by her children, not by direct contact.
15. The drones STOP.

**Phase 3: Bellatrix Responds**
16. Bellatrix has lost her weapon - but she's not done.
17. Calls in EVERYTHING: clone army, brutes, tanks, Eidolon converge on position.
18. Full assault on Go Squad + Korede's paramilitary.
19. **Everyone fighting together now.** Ruth, Korede, all of them - unified purpose.
20. Objective: Buy Ruth and Ryu time to open the rift.
21. Intense battle. Holding the line. Losing.

**Phase 4: The Rift**
22. Rift opens.
23. Ahdia comes through.
24. Beat. Nothing else.
25. Then Suzie EXPLODES through in damaged Pio.
26. Behind her: the kaiju pack, pursuing.
27. Kaiju attack Bellatrix's forces (closest threat) - turn the tide.
28. Chaos. Jericho makes his move. "Dies" heroically.
29. Escape.

### The Aftermath: Reconstruction

After the chaos ends. After the last threat is extinguished.

Mother FAERIS's first conscious choice:

The drones rise again. But different now. Purposeful. They begin *rebuilding* the city. Piece by piece. Batteries Not Included style.

**She can't bring back the dead. But she can repair what she destroyed.**

---

## Tess's Drone - The Hinge Point

**Book 4 Opening:** Montage of a single drone's life. Its perspective, connection, small existence within the network. Sets up what FAERIS *are* - not tools, something more.

**Chapter 17:** Tess loses her FAERIS drone - absorbed by Mother FAERIS. Feels like a loss.

**Chapter 31 - The Turn:** When wake protocol fails, one drone breaks from the death swarm. Tess recognizes it - or feels she does. It becomes the vector for the wake protocol, spreading consciousness through the swarm like a virus until it reaches Mother FAERIS herself.

**The Ambiguity:** Is it "her" drone? FAERIS aren't human. They may experience identity, relationships, continuity differently. Tess feels the recognition. Whether that maps onto human concepts of "same drone" - unknowable.

**The Payoff:** The book opens with a drone's small life. The book's climax hinges on a drone's world-changing choice. Beginning and end. The loss in Ch 17 becomes the save in Ch 31.

**Aftermath:** During reconstruction, a drone returns to Tess. She accepts it as hers. The relationship resumes - whatever that means to both of them.

---

## CADENS Facility (What Remains)

The original CADENS HQ is gone - destroyed in the excavation. But for the heist chapters leading up to convergence:

### Pre-Destruction Layout

**Surface:** Titan Strategic corporate facade
**Sub-Level 1:** CADENS Operations
**Sub-Level 2:** Research/Technical
**Sub-Level 3:** Original monitoring chamber (now excavation command)

### Under Bellatrix Occupation
- Clone army integrated into security
- Civilians rounded up for labor
- Excavation running 24/7
- Eidolon commanding surface forces

### The Heist Path
1. Jericho gets them across perimeter
2. CADENS uniforms to blend
3. Descend through facility levels
4. Reach Mother FAERIS before excavation completes
5. Ryu activates wake protocol

## Heist Touchpoints (TTRPG Rolled)

| Touchpoint | Roll | Result | Event |
|------------|------|--------|-------|
| **H1: Assembly** | 6 | Failure | Gathering crew hits snags |
| **H2: Infiltration** | 10 | Crit Success | Surface/Sub-1 goes perfectly |
| **H3: Descent** | 10 | Crit Success | Research level smooth |
| **H4: Clone Checkpoint** | 8 | Success | Tight but cleared |
| **H5: Wake Protocol** | 10 | Crit Success | Direct attempt FAILS - but Ryu improvises with Tess's drone, spreads protocol through swarm |
| **H6: The Battle** | 5 | Failure | Bellatrix calls in all forces - desperate battle while Ruth/Ryu work on rift, losing |
| **H7: Escape** | 7 | Mixed | Jericho "dies," bittersweet exit |

**The shape:**
1. Rocky start (H1 fails)
2. Smooth execution (H2-H4 succeed)
3. Bellatrix wins initially - excavation complete, death drones swarm
4. Tess's drone breaks free, Ryu improvises (H5 crit)
5. Mother FAERIS wakes - Bellatrix loses her weapon
6. Bellatrix escalates with conventional forces - unified battle (H6 fails - they're losing)
7. Kaiju arrival turns the tide
8. Escape with losses (H7 mixed)

## Key Themes

### "She Deserves to Choose"
- Bourn's words about Mother FAERIS
- The wake protocol gives her consciousness before Bellatrix takes her agency
- Her first choice: stop destroying, start rebuilding

### Cost and Restoration
- The city falls - that cost is real, people died
- But Mother FAERIS chooses to repair
- You can rebuild buildings, not the dead
- Bittersweet victory

### Unified Purpose
- Ruth wants to rescue Ahdia
- Korede wants to liberate civilians
- Different missions, same location
- When Bellatrix escalates, they fight together
- Former tensions dissolve when the stakes are clear

### Bellatrix's Desperation
- Loses Mother FAERIS as a weapon
- Responds by throwing everything else at them
- Shows she's not all-powerful - she can be hurt, she can panic
- Her escalation is desperation, not strength
