**Chapter Type:** Earth POV
**Timeline:** Ruth's Quest (B')
**Follows:** Chapter 19 (Korede's second wave)

## SCENE 1: Analyzing the Signal

**Location:** Safe house / resistance technical facility
**Characters:** Ruth, Diana, Ryu, Jericho, Tess

**TTRPG Results:**
- Roll: 8 (Partial Success)
- Complications: Signal degrading, time dilation horror, team dependent on Jericho

### STORY BEATS:

**Setup:**
1. Team gathered around Mother FAERIS's detection readouts
2. The anomalous signal from The Between - persistent but irregular
3. Ruth: "It's her. It has to be her."
4. Diana: "We need to understand what we're seeing before we can act on it."

**The Analysis:**
5. Diana studies the pattern: "It's not a transmission. It's a disturbance. Something is disrupting dimensional space from within The Between."
6. Ryu: "Like ripples. Fold echoes."
7. Diana: "Temporal wake. Her powers bleeding outward instead of affecting local spacetime."
8. Jericho, quiet until now: "Substrate harmonics."
9. Everyone looks at him.
10. Jericho: "I've seen patterns like this before. In the ancient signals I study. Radio waves and light that have traveled for millions of years."
11. His expertise suddenly central. He's the only one who's worked with anything similar.

**COMPLICATION - Signal Degrading:**
12. Mother FAERIS: "Signal strength declining. Rate of decay: 3.2% per day."
13. Ryu: "It's fading."
14. Diana: "She's either getting weaker, or moving further from the breach point."
15. Ruth: "How long do we have?"
16. Diana: "At this rate? Two weeks before it's undetectable."
17. Clock starts ticking.

**COMPLICATION - Time Dilation Horror:**
18. Diana runs calculations. Goes pale.
19. Ruth: "What?"
20. Diana: "The temporal differential between dimensions... if these readings are correct..."
21. Ryu: "Diana. What?"
22. Diana: "Weeks for us. Months for her."
23. Silence.
24. Ruth: "How long has she been alone?"
25. Diana: "If the rift opened three weeks ago our time... she's experienced approximately four months."
26. Tess: "Four months. Alone."
27. The weight of it hits everyone.
28. Ruth's jaw sets. "Then we move now."

**COMPLICATION - Dependence on Jericho:**
29. Ryu: "We need to trace the signal path. Figure out how to reach her."
30. Diana: "The mathematics are beyond standard physics. Trans-dimensional frequency interpretation."
31. Jericho: "I can do it."
32. Tess, suspicious: "You've done this before?"
33. Jericho: "Not exactly this. But I've spent thirty years reading patterns others dismiss as noise. This is what I do."
34. Ruth looks at Diana. Diana nods slowly - they need him.
35. Ruth: "Do it."
36. Jericho begins working. The team watches. Dependent on him now.
37. Diana catches Ryu's eye. Neither says anything. But the unease is there.

### CONSEQUENCES SEEDED:

- Signal fading - two week window
- Ahdia has been alone four months (devastating)
- Jericho now indispensable to the mission
- Team dependent on someone they can't fully verify
- Clock ticking on multiple fronts

### EMOTIONAL ARC:

- Ruth: Hope → Horror (four months) → Fierce determination
- Diana: Analytical → Devastated by time calculation → Resolved
- Ryu: Supportive → Shaken → Watching Jericho carefully
- Tess: Engaged → Suspicious of Jericho → No choice but to proceed
- Jericho: Quiet → Suddenly central → Calm expertise (too calm?)

## SCENE 2: Devising the Solution

**Location:** Technical facility
**Characters:** Ruth, Diana, Ryu, Jericho, Tess

**TTRPG Results:**
- Roll: 1 (Critical Failure)
- Complication: Equipment damaged - they only get ONE shot

### STORY BEATS:

**The Problem:**
1. Jericho maps the signal path - the temporal wake Ahdia's powers created
2. Diana: "We can trace it. But tracing isn't communicating."
3. Ruth: "Can she send us anything? A message? A sign?"
4. Jericho: "The signal IS her message. She just doesn't know she's sending it."
5. Ryu: "Every time she tries to use her powers..."
6. Jericho: "She thinks they fail. But they're bleeding outward instead. That's what we're detecting."
7. Ruth: "So she doesn't know we can see her."
8. Diana: "And we can't send back the same way. We don't have temporal powers."

**The Solution:**
9. Ryu: "What if we don't need temporal powers?"
10. Everyone looks at him.
11. Ryu: "The wake exists. It's a path. What if we send something along it?"
12. Diana, catching on: "Data. Compressed data."
13. Jericho: "Picoframe technology. Compress hours of video into microsecond bursts."
14. Tess: "It would look like static. Interference."
15. Ryu: "Unless someone was looking for it. Unless someone decoded it."
16. Diana: "We pepper the temporal wake with compressed video messages. One-way broadcast."
17. Ruth: "She'd see us. Know we're coming."
18. Jericho: "If she can decode it. If AR-Ryu can detect the pattern."
19. Ruth: "He will. He's Ryu." Looks at Ryu. "You'd find it."
20. Ryu, quiet: "I would."

**THE CRITICAL FAILURE:**
21. Jericho: "We need to calibrate the equipment to match the wake's frequency."
22. Tess: "I can interface with the FAERIS systems. Boost the signal."
23. She reaches for the connection - her bond with FAERIS tech.
24. Something WRONG.
25. Feedback screech. Tess yanks back. Equipment sparks.
26. Mother FAERIS: "Calibration failure. Primary transmission array damaged."
27. Ruth: "What happened?"
28. Jericho, examining: "The frequency variance was too extreme. The equipment couldn't handle the adjustment."
29. Ryu: "Can we fix it?"
30. Jericho: Long pause. "We can make it work once."
31. Diana: "Once."
32. Jericho: "One transmission. No test runs. No confirmation pulse. We send the message and hope it arrives."
33. Tess, shaken: "I'm sorry. I thought I could—"
34. Ruth: "It's not your fault."
35. But the damage is done. One shot. That's all they get.

**Aftermath:**
36. Silence in the room.
37. Ruth: "Then we make it count."
38. Diana: "We should record the message now. While we have time to get it right."
39. Ryu: "What do we say?"
40. Ruth: "We tell her we're coming. And we tell her where to be."

### CONSEQUENCES SEEDED:

- Only ONE transmission possible - no test, no confirmation
- Tess carries guilt for the failure
- Jericho "makes it work" - more dependence on him
- Team must record message without knowing if it will arrive
- Stakes raised - no margin for error

### EMOTIONAL ARC:

- Ruth: Determined → Hopeful (solution!) → Devastated (one shot) → Resolved
- Tess: Confident → Failure → Guilt → Withdrawn
- Diana: Analytical → Excited → Grim acceptance
- Ryu: Hopeful → Horror at failure → Quiet resolve
- Jericho: Helpful → Calm in crisis (too calm) → "I can fix this"

## SCENE 3: Sending the Message

**Location:** Technical facility
**Characters:** Ruth, Diana, Ryu, Jericho, Tess, (others for video)

**TTRPG Results:**
- Roll: 15 (Success)
- The message goes out

### STORY BEATS:

**Recording:**
1. They set up for recording. Picoframe compression ready.
2. Ruth: "Everyone who wants to say something. Now's the time."
3. One by one, they record.
4. Ruth goes first: "Ahdia. We found you. We're coming. Don't give up."
5. Diana, precise: "Return to the original rift coordinates. We're reopening the breach. The window will be short."
6. Ryu, struggling: "I'm here. AR-Ryu is... I know he's taking care of you. I would. I am." Voice cracks.
7. Tess: "We miss you. Every day."
8. Others add their pieces - short, heartfelt, desperate.

**The Core Message:**
9. Diana records the critical information:
10. "If you can see this, you need to return to where you entered The Between."
11. "We're going to reopen the rift."
12. "We can't keep it open for long."
13. "You have to be there when it opens."
14. "We don't know when. But soon. As soon as we can."
15. "Be there. Please. Be there."

**The Transmission:**
16. Jericho: "Compression complete. Ready to transmit."
17. Ruth: "Do it."
18. Jericho's hands on the controls. The damaged equipment hums.
19. Diana: "Signal pathway locked."
20. Ryu: "Picoframe burst ready."
21. Jericho: "Transmitting."
22. A pulse. Data compressed into microseconds. Peppered along the temporal wake.
23. Looks like static. Interference. Nothing.
24. Unless someone is looking for it.

**SUCCESS:**
25. Mother FAERIS: "Transmission complete. Signal integrity: 94%."
26. Diana: "It went out."
27. Ryu: "Did it reach her?"
28. Jericho: "We have no way to know."
29. Silence.
30. Ruth: "It reached her."
31. Diana: "Ruth, we can't confirm—"
32. Ruth: "I don't need confirmation. It reached her."
33. Faith. Pure faith.

**What Comes Next:**
34. Ruth: "Now we go get her."
35. Diana: "We still need to reach Mother FAERIS. Open the rift."
36. Ryu: "CADENS is enemy territory now."
37. Jericho: "I can get us in. I know the facility. I know the security."
38. Ruth looks at him. The team's dependence on him complete now.
39. Ruth: "Then that's the plan. We get to CADENS. We get to Mother FAERIS. We open the rift."
40. Jericho: "And we bring her home."
41. He sounds sincere. Maybe he even means part of it.
42. But his eyes flick to the equipment. To Mother FAERIS's readouts.
43. Everything is falling into place. For everyone.

### CONSEQUENCES SEEDED:

- Message sent - no confirmation possible
- Ruth operating on faith
- Team now committed to CADENS infiltration
- Jericho positioned as essential guide
- Next phase: Journey to CADENS (Chapter 22+)
- Ryu's message to AR-Ryu - emotional weight

### EMOTIONAL ARC:

- Ruth: Determined → Emotional (recording) → Faith → "Now we go get her"
- Ryu: Struggling → Recording for his other self → Hope
- Diana: Precise → Allows emotion in message → Returns to mission focus
- Tess: Guilt → Contributing to message → Some relief
- Jericho: Helpful throughout → Everything going according to plan

## THREADS FOR LATER:

- Will Ahdia receive the message? (Yes - via Pio's comm after meeting Suzie)
- AR-Ryu will decode it - because he's Ryu
- Jericho's helpfulness is all manipulation - Book 5 reveal
- Tess's guilt may affect her later decisions
- Ryu's recording creates emotional resonance for AR-Ryu's death
- Time dilation means Ahdia experiences more isolation before message arrives
