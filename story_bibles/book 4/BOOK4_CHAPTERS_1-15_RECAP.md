## Chapter 15: The Signal

### Setting: International Artificial Sun Facility (Neutral Nation)

**ARRIVAL:**
- **Team present:** Ruth, Diana, Ben, Victor, Tess, Korede, resistance leaders
- **Gap in story:** How did they get from Caledonia guerrilla warfare to international facility?
- Diplomatic escort, security clearance
- Facility director skeptical but granting limited access

**THE BRIEFING:**
- Diana explains dimensional rift theory to scientists
- Scientists skeptical: "This is theoretical"
- Diana: "We've witnessed it. Our team member was forced through."
- Need to open controlled rift to retrieve Ahdia

**MOTHER FAERIS:**
- Ryu presents Mother FAERIS to facility
- Mother: "I can facilitate rift opening"
- Scientists shocked, awed
- Mother FAERIS provides technical specifications
- Credibility established

**THE DETECTION:**
- Mother FAERIS: "Detecting anomalous transmission"
- Origin: Dimensional substrate (The Between)
- Pattern: Artificial, non-random
- Signal strength: 0.003%
- **Ruth: "Ahdia?"**

**THE DEBATE:**
- Ben: "It HAS to be her"
- Victor: "Could be trap"
- Scientists: "Signal too weak for message content, just carrier wave"
- Tess: "But it's ARTIFICIAL. Someone is sending it."
- Korede: "From exact coordinates Diana calculated"

**THE RISK:**
- Opening rift requires collapsing fusion reaction
- 4-minute window before supernova event
- If rift stays open too long: Catastrophic energy release
- Facility, city, possibly region obliterated
- Million+ lives at risk

**RUTH'S CHOICE:**
- Director: "I cannot authorize. Risk too great."
- Ruth: "That signal is a person. My family."
- Director weighs personal loyalty vs public safety

**AUTHORIZATION DENIED (REVISED ENDING):**
- Director: "I need 24 hours to consider"
- Ruth: "We don't have time. Signal is active NOW."
- Director: "I need to be certain. We'll evacuate as precaution."
- Authorization DENIED (for now)
- Team must wait
- Signal still transmitting

**CHAPTER ENDS:** Unbearable waiting, hope deferred

## Major Questions/Gaps

### 1. How did team get to facility?
- Chapters 1-14: Guerrilla warfare in Caledonia
- Chapter 15: At international fusion facility
- **Missing:** Journey from Caledonia to neutral nation
- **Missing:** How did they secure access?
- **Missing:** Who arranged diplomatic clearance?

### 2. Who is the facility director?
- Not CADENS
- Not Harriet Bourn (fugitive)
- International neutral nation authority
- Weighing political/humanitarian decision

### 3. What's the actual conflict for Earth arc?
- If director is delaying (not denying), what's Ruth fighting?
- Pattern: "CADENS waits, Go Squad go"
- Does Ruth act anyway despite director's hesitation?
- What's the opposition in Chapters 17-29?

### 4. Korede's role unclear
- Appears Chapter 14 with resistance
- Present at facility Chapter 15
- What's his stake in Ahdia rescue?
- Why would he leave resistance to help?

## Status at Chapter 15 End

**Location:** International artificial sun facility

**Ruth's Coalition:**
- Ruth, Diana, Ben, Victor, Tess
- United goal: Rescue Ahdia
- Believes signal is her

**Opposition:**
- Facility director (cautious, needs certainty)
- Scientists (risk-averse)
- Political complications

**The Signal:**
- Active transmission from The Between
- Artificial pattern
- Coordinates match Diana's calculations
- Too weak to decode content
- Could be Ahdia... or trap

**Next:** Chapter 16 flashback to Ahdia arriving in The Between

---

**Notes for User:**
- Chapters 1-14 track team reunification during guerrilla warfare
- Chapter 15 jumps to facility without explaining transition
- "Authorization denied" creates waiting/bureaucracy conflict
- But does this match "CADENS waits, Go Squad go" pattern?
- Need to clarify actual Earth arc conflict for Chapters 17-29
