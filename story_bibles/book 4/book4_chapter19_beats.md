# Book 4 - Chapter 19 Beats

**Chapter Type:** Earth POV (Braided - odd chapter)
**Timeline:** Korede's Front (A'')
**Follows:** Chapter 17 Scene 2 (first wave repelled)

---

## SCENE 1: The Second Wave

**Location:** Korede's sector - civilian district
**Characters:** Korede, Ben, Victor, Leah

**TTRPG Results:**
- Roll: 6 (Partial Success)
- Approach: Fighting retreat - give ground strategically, funnel into killzones

### STORY BEATS:

**The Tactic:**
1. Clone avatar army returns—double the numbers
2. Ben calls it: "We can't hold this position against double the numbers."
3. Korede hates it—retreat feels like losing
4. But Ben's right. Fall back, funnel them, buy time.
5. Victor already moving evacuation to secondary routes

**The Execution:**
6. Controlled withdrawal through pre-mapped chokepoints
7. Clone avatars pour into gaps—exactly where Ben wants them
8. Crossfire positions tear through black-eyed ranks
9. Civilians streaming out behind them, hundreds more saved

**THE COST (Partial Success):**
10. Leah doesn't fall back fast enough
11. Holding position too long—mirror of Korede's rage, less control
12. Clone avatars swarm her flank
13. Korede breaks formation to pull her out
14. Gets her clear, but takes a hit—bleeding, not fatal
15. Lost eastern chokepoint. Enemy has foothold.

**Aftermath:**
16. Civilians evacuated. Win.
17. Eastern sector compromised. Problem.
18. Korede bleeding, Leah shaken—she almost got him killed
19. Ben: "That position wasn't worth dying for."
20. Leah: "I had them."
21. Korede says nothing. Understands exactly why she didn't fall back.

## SCENE 2: Korede and Leah

**Location:** Medical station, post-battle
**Characters:** Korede, Leah

**TTRPG Results:**
- Roll: 12 (Success)
- Approach: Silence - the look says everything

### STORY BEATS:

1. Medic patching Korede's side. Leah standing three feet away.
2. She opens her mouth—apology, explanation, something
3. Korede just looks at her
4. Not angry. Not forgiving. *Knowing.*
5. "You don't have to say it."
6. She closes her mouth.
7. He knows why she held that position. Same reason he would have.
8. Same fire. Same grief dressed as rage.
9. The silence stretches. Not uncomfortable. *Honest.*
10. Leah finally: "How do you stop?"
11. Korede: "I'll let you know when I figure it out."
12. First crack in both their armor—not fixed, but *seen*

**What This Establishes:**
- Korede and Leah recognize each other now
- Not romance—*kinship*. Two people burning the same way.
- He's slightly ahead on the path (trying to control it)
- She's a warning of where he could go if he stops trying
- Neither is okay. Both know it now.

## SCENE 3: Victor's Concern

**Location:** Medical station
**Characters:** Victor, Korede

**TTRPG Results:**
- Roll: 2 (Complication)
- Approach: Medic angle - uses wound as excuse to talk

### STORY BEATS:

1. Victor approaches after medic leaves. "Let me check that."
2. Korede: "It's fine. Patched."
3. Victor sits anyway. Re-examines bandage.
4. "You broke formation out there."
5. Korede stiffens. "Leah needed—"
6. "I know what Leah needed. I'm asking about you."

**THE COMPLICATION:**
7. Victor pushes too hard: "This isn't about her. You've been wanting to break since Leta—"
8. Korede's jaw locks. *Wrong name. Wrong moment.*
9. "Don't."
10. Victor: "Korede, I'm trying to—"
11. "I said *don't.*"
12. Korede stands. Wound pulls. Doesn't care.
13. "You don't get to use her name to manage me."
14. Walks away. Victor left sitting there.

**What This Breaks:**
15. Victor was right. That's the problem.
16. Korede *knows* Victor was right.
17. But Leta's name used as diagnosis? As leverage?
18. Something shut down. Wall went up.
19. Victor now on the outside—for now.
20. The one person watching Korede closest just got locked out.

## SCENE 4a: Fear Wave

**Location:** Defensive line
**Characters:** All defenders, Eidolon (presence)

**TTRPG Results:**
- Roll: 8 (Partial Success)
- Situation: Eidolon's aura hits the defensive line

### STORY BEATS:

1. Hits like a cold tide. Creeping dread, then full panic.
2. Eidolon's aura washing over defensive positions.
3. Veterans seeing worst memories surface.
4. Newer fighters? Some just *run*.

**The Line Fractures:**
5. Ben shouting commands, trying to hold cohesion
6. Half the fighters digging in—training overriding terror
7. Other half breaking, streaming backward
8. Gaps opening in defense. Clone avatars pushing through.
9. Victor grabbing runners: "Hold! HOLD!"
10. Some stop. Some keep going.

**What Holds:**
11. Core group around Korede, Leah, Ben stays intact
12. The ones who've faced death before—shaking but standing
13. Enough for *something*. Not a line. A cluster.
14. Defensive position now a shrinking island

## SCENE 4b: Personal Targeting

**Location:** Defensive position
**Characters:** Korede, Eidolon (attacker)

**TTRPG Results:**
- Roll: 5 (Complication)
- Situation: Eidolon pushes fear directly at Korede - all three visions

### STORY BEATS:

**Leta's Death (First Wave):**
1. Hits without warning. He's *there* again.
2. The moment he found her. The body that used to be his sister.
3. What they did to her. Every detail he's tried to bury.
4. He staggers. Weapon drops.

**Becoming the Monster (Second Wave):**
5. Vision shifts. He's standing over bodies.
6. But he's the one who made them.
7. Looks down at hands—covered in blood.
8. Looks up at reflection. His eyes are *black*.
9. "You're already one of us," something whispers.

**Everyone He Fails (Third Wave):**
10. The civilians he's protecting. Dying.
11. Leah. Ben. Victor. Dying.
12. Because he wasn't fast enough. Strong enough.
13. Because he was too busy *feeling* to fight.
14. "They're all going to die and it's your fault."

**THE BREAK:**
15. Korede on his knees. Hands over ears. Screaming.
16. Not words. Just sound.
17. The rage holding him together—not enough against this.
18. He's *drowning*.
19. Fighters see their strongest guy collapse.
20. Morale shatters further.

**What Eidolon Learns:**
21. *This one has so much fear underneath the anger.*
22. *Delicious.*

## SCENE 4c: Civilian Terror - Leah's Stand

**Location:** Evacuation routes / chokepoint
**Characters:** Leah, Ben, Victor, civilians

**TTRPG Results:**
- Roll: 14 (Success)
- Approach: Leah steps up while Korede's down

### STORY BEATS:

**The Stampede Begins:**
1. Evacuation routes hit with fear wave
2. Thousands of civilians breaking
3. Crushing. Trampling. Everywhere.
4. Clone avatars pushing toward chaos

**Leah's Choice:**
5. Looks at Korede on his knees. Screaming.
6. Looks at evacuation routes collapsing.
7. *He saved me. Now I save them.*
8. Doesn't hesitate.

**The Stand:**
9. Leah sprints to chokepoint between clone army and civilians
10. Not rage this time. *Focus.*
11. Channels everything Korede showed her—controlled, directed
12. "MOVE! Keep moving! Don't look back!"
13. Her voice cuts through panic. Command, not fear.

**What She Does:**
14. Holds the gap *alone* for ninety seconds
15. Not killing—*blocking*. Buying time.
16. Ben gets fighters repositioned around her
17. Victor redirects civilian flow to secondary routes
18. Stampede slows. Not stopped, but *managed*.

**The Cost:**
19. Leah's taken hits. Multiple. Still standing.
20. When Ben's fighters reach her, swaying but upright.
21. "I had them." This time it's true.

**What This Means:**
22. Leah became something more than Korede's mirror
23. Used the fire *right*
24. First proof rage can be tool, not just curse
25. Korede—when he comes back—will see what he's capable of too

## CONSEQUENCES SEEDED:

- Korede broken temporarily by Eidolon—needs recovery
- Leah elevated—proved herself, used rage constructively
- Victor locked out from Korede (trust fractured)
- Defense fractured but holding
- Eastern chokepoint lost
- Eidolon knows Korede's weakness (fear underneath rage)
- Civilians mostly evacuated but losses taken

## EMOTIONAL ARCS:

- **Korede:** Control → Wound → Kinship with Leah → Locks out Victor → Broken by Eidolon
- **Leah:** Guilt → Seen/understood → Steps up → Proves herself
- **Victor:** Concern → Wrong approach → Locked out
- **Ben:** Tactical throughout, holding pieces together

## THREADS FOR LATER:

- Korede's recovery from psychological break
- Victor rebuilding trust with Korede
- Leah's new role—no longer just mirror
- Eidolon will target Korede again
- Eastern sector vulnerability
