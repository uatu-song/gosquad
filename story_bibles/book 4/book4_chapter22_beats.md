## Story Beats

### Beat 1: Assembly
- Ruth has called everyone together
- First time full crew is in one place (physically or virtually)
- Tension: they've been scattered, working different angles
- Now it's time to commit to a plan

### Beat 2: The Assets
- Ryu: "I have the wake protocol. Bourn gave it to me. I know how to use it."
- Tess: "I know FAERIS. If we get close to Mother FAERIS, I can help interface."
- Jericho: "I can get you in. CADENS uniforms, credentials, the route down. I know the facility."
- Bourn (remote): Provides layout intel, security patterns, excavation timeline
- Everything sounds... possible

### Beat 3: The Plan Takes Shape
- Jericho walks them through infiltration route
- Surface entry, descent through levels, reach Mother FAERIS
- Activate wake protocol before excavation completes
- She wakes, opens the rift, Ahdia comes home
- It sounds clean. Professional. Doable.

### Beat 4: Diana's Concerns
- Diana has been quiet
- Ruth: "Diana. What do you see?"
- Diana doesn't sugarcoat it:
  - "Bellatrix has been doing this for 3.7 billion years."
  - "She doesn't make mistakes. She makes traps."
  - "The excavation timeline, the security gaps, Jericho's access - it's clean. Too clean."
  - "Any plan you can think of, she's already thought of."
  - "You're not outsmarting her. You're walking into her house."

### Beat 5: Doubt Creeps In
- The room goes quiet
- The plan that sounded professional now sounds naive
- Tess: "So what do we do?"
- Diana: "I'm not saying don't go. I'm saying know what you're walking into."
- Ryu looks at Jericho (buried suspicion? or just processing?)
- Jericho stays calm, supportive: "Diana's right to be cautious. But we don't have another option."

### Beat 6: Ruth Rallies
- Ruth doesn't dismiss Diana's concerns
- "She's right. We probably can't outsmart Bellatrix."
- "But we're not trying to outsmart her."
- "We're trying to reach Mother FAERIS before the excavation completes. That's it."
- "We're not pulling a con. We're running a rescue."
- Beat: "I don't have proof this will work. I have faith."

### Beat 7: Diana's Gift
- Diana provides what she can:
  - Bellatrix's patterns - when she's likely on-site vs. away
  - Her blind spots - she underestimates humans, thinks in cosmic timescales
  - Likely responses if things go wrong
- "This is everything I know about how she thinks."
- Unspoken: Diana can't come with them. If she gets close, Bellatrix senses her.

### Beat 8: Commitment
- They proceed, but sobered
- No bravado, no heist-movie confidence
- Just desperate people doing the only thing they can
- Ruth: "We leave tomorrow."

## Emotional Beats

- **Opening:** Cautious hope - the team is together, they have a plan
- **Middle:** Creeping doubt - Diana's concerns land hard
- **Closing:** Grim determination - not confidence, just commitment

---

## Consequences

- Plan is set (Jericho's infiltration route)
- Team is aware this is a long shot
- Diana's warnings hang over everything
- Ryu trusts Jericho (setup for Book 5 devastation)
- Ruth's faith vs. certainty theme reinforced

---

## Tension
Increases - from "we have a plan" to "we have a plan that probably won't work but it's all we have"

---

## What Could Happen Next
1. Infiltration begins (Chapter 24)
2. Between chapter with Ahdia (Chapter 23)
3. Korede's storyline intercutting

---

## Notes

**Why the roll is a "failure":** The failure isn't that they can't assemble - it's that Diana's concerns puncture their confidence. They proceed anyway, but damaged. The plan hasn't failed yet, but their belief in it has taken a hit.

**Jericho's performance:** He's supportive, calm, reasonable. "Diana's right to be cautious." Everything he says is exactly what a good ally would say. No tells. No hints. Just a man helping his friends.

**Diana's position:** She knows more than she's saying. Not about Jericho - about herself. She's saving herself for something (transcendence). She can't be there when it matters. This is her contribution: truth.

**Status:** Beat sheet complete. Ready for prose or TTRPG rolling.
