# Book 4 - Chapter 17 Beats

**Chapter Type:** Earth POV (Braided - odd chapter)
**Timelines Active:** Ruth's Quest (B'), Korede's Front (A''), Antagonist (B''')

---

## SCENE 1: Finding Bourn

**Location:** Safe house → various contacts → dead drops
**Characters:** Ruth, Diana, Tess, Ryu

**TTRPG Results:**
- Roll 1: 2 (Complication) - First contact is dead/compromised
- Roll 2: 3 (Complication) - Second channel draws unwanted attention
- Roll 3: 7 (Partial Success) - Finally reach Bourn, but she's paranoid and demands proof

### STORY BEATS:

**Setup:**
1. Team reeling from Korede's refusal in Chapter 15
2. Ruth: "We need intel on CADENS. Layout, security, where they're keeping Mother FAERIS."
3. Ryu: "Bourn. She was Director. She knows everything about that facility."
4. Diana: "She's been underground since Book 3. No one's seen her."
5. Ruth: "Then we find her."

**THE HUNT:**
6. Ryu knows old channels from when Bourn gave him the wake protocol
7. Dead drops, coded frequencies, resistance contacts
8. Bourn is GOOD at hiding - survived this long for a reason

**COMPLICATION (Roll: 2):**
9. First contact point - a resistance sympathizer who knew Bourn's location
10. They arrive: the contact is dead. Recent. Professional.
11. Someone else is hunting Bourn too.
12. Diana: "Bellatrix's people? TRIOMF remnants?"
13. Ruth: "Doesn't matter. We're not the only ones looking."
14. Clock just started ticking.

**COMPLICATION (Roll: 3):**
15. Second channel - encrypted frequency Bourn used for emergencies
16. Ryu broadcasts the recognition code
17. They wait. Static.
18. Then: movement outside. They've been triangulated.
19. Clone patrol responding to the signal
20. Quick extraction - Tess's FAERIS drone provides cover
21. They got away, but they've made noise. Bellatrix knows someone's poking around.

**PARTIAL SUCCESS (Roll: 7):**
22. Third attempt - Ryu remembers something Bourn said when she gave him the wake protocol
23. A phrase. A location only she would know.
24. They find her. Safehouse within a safehouse. Paranoid setup.
25. Bourn, gun raised: "Give me one reason not to shoot."
26. Ryu: "You gave me the wake protocol. You said 'She deserves to choose.'"
27. Bourn lowers the gun. Barely.
28. "You shouldn't have found me. If you found me, others can too."
29. Ruth: "We need to get to Mother FAERIS. Wake her. Open a rift."
30. Bourn: "Impossible. CADENS is locked down. Bellatrix has it."
31. Ruth: "There has to be a way."
32. Bourn, long pause: "...I have someone inside."

### CONSEQUENCES SEEDED:

- Bourn found, but at cost (noise made, attention drawn)
- Someone else hunting Bourn (who?)
- Bourn has an asset inside CADENS (Jericho - not yet named)
- Wake protocol context: Ryu has it, Bourn gave it to him Book 3
- Team now on Bellatrix's radar
- Bourn paranoid but willing to help

### EMOTIONAL ARC:

- Ruth: Determined → Frustrated → Relieved → Focused
- Ryu: Confident (knows channels) → Shaken (contact dead) → Resolute
- Diana: Analytical → Concerned (they're being hunted)
- Tess: Support role → Proves value in extraction

---

## SCENE 2: Bourn's Asset

**Location:** Bourn's safehouse
**Characters:** Ruth, Diana, Tess, Ryu, Harriet Bourn

**TTRPG Results:**
- Roll 1: 2 (Complication) - Bourn's comm channel to asset goes dark mid-check-in
- Roll 2: 3 (Complication) - Tess sends FAERIS drone to scout, it's severed/absorbed by Mother FAERIS
- Roll 3: 7 (Partial Success) - Ryu scouts alone, finds Jericho, confirms he's the asset

### STORY BEATS:

1. Bourn explains: "I have someone inside. CADENS. High level. He's been feeding me intel for months."
2. Won't say who - need-to-know basis
3. Ruth trusts Bourn's judgment, team agrees to move forward

**COMPLICATION (Roll: 2):**
4. Bourn checks in with asset - channel goes dead mid-conversation
5. Three possibilities: caught, gone dark for OpSec, channel compromised
6. Bourn's face says it all: *This has never happened before*
7. Diana: "If he's compromised, walking into that meet is a trap."
8. Ruth: "And if he's just being careful, we lose our only way in."
9. Decision: Send a scout first

**COMPLICATION (Roll: 3):**
10. Tess sends FAERIS drone to scout rendezvous point (old CADENS auxiliary facility)
11. Drone gets within range - feed doesn't go to static, it's *severed*
12. Tess, pale: "That's not jamming. That's... something recognized her. Something FAERIS."
13. Implication: Mother FAERIS detected the drone, absorbed it
14. Tess feels the absence - first time without her drone since Book 1
15. More red flags: Asset dark, drone lost, pattern suggests trap
16. Ryu volunteers to go alone: "If it's who I think it is, I can get answers."

**PARTIAL SUCCESS (Roll: 7):**
17. Ryu approaches auxiliary facility - dark, quiet, too empty
18. Voice from shadows: "You shouldn't have come yourself."
19. Jericho steps out - calm, controlled
20. **REVEAL:** Jericho is Bourn's asset
21. Jericho explains: Mother FAERIS detected drone, he had to burn comm channel to keep cover
22. "She's aware now. The Mother. Your drone got too close and she... tasted it."
23. Intel is good - Jericho has access, can get them to Mother FAERIS

**THE COST:**
24. Ryu sees something in Jericho's eyes - a flicker, just for a moment
25. *Something's different about him*
26. Pushes it down - this is his mentor, the man who believed in him
27. Reports to team: "It's him. He's legit. We're in."
28. **What Ryu doesn't say:** The feeling in his gut that something's wrong

### CONSEQUENCES SEEDED:

- Jericho revealed as Bourn's asset (cover story intact)
- Tess's FAERIS drone lost to Mother FAERIS (first time without it since Book 1)
- Ryu has buried suspicion he won't voice (amplifies Book 5 devastation)
- Mother FAERIS is *aware* something's coming
- Team has their way in - at cost

### EMOTIONAL ARC:

- Ruth: Hope → Frustration → Cautious relief
- Tess: Confidence → Loss (drone) → Grief masked as focus
- Ryu: Determination → Unease → Denial
- Diana: Suspicion throughout (but no proof)
- Bourn: Controlled → Rattled → Professional mask restored

### CHARACTER NOTES:

**Jericho-Ryu Relationship:**
- Jericho joined CADENS after Book 1
- Mentored Ryu during Books 2-3 (6-8 months)
- Real bond formed - Jericho believed in Ryu, guided him
- Recent but intense relationship
- Book 5 betrayal will cut deep

**Tess's Loss:**
- First time without FAERIS drone since Book 1
- Can *feel* the absence
- Mother FAERIS "tasted" her drone - violated, absorbed
- Sets up Tess's relationship with Mother FAERIS later

## SCENE 3: Korede's Front - The Assault Begins

**Touchpoint:** A'' - Clone army + Eidolon assault begins; civilians trapped
**Characters:** Korede, Ben, Victor, Leah
**Location:** Korede's sector - civilian district near CADENS excavation zone

**TTRPG Results:**
- Roll: 15 (Success) - Controlled aggression, leash holds

### STORY BEATS:

**Setup:**
1. Black-eyed soldiers (clone avatars) pour into civilian district
2. Bellatrix's excavation requires clearing the area - razing, not evacuating
3. Korede's resistance cell is the only defense for thousands of civilians

**Korede's Internal Conflict:**
4. Wants to kill them - rage from Leta's murder
5. Clone avatars are perfect target: enemy AND "not really people"
6. But violence doesn't feel like justice - feels like what he hated in them
7. "I'm not like them" - but in battle, the difference blurs

**The Battle (Roll: 15 - Success):**
8. Korede keeps the rage leashed. Barely.
9. Fights at the front - not reckless, not hanging back
10. Cold efficiency Ben taught him, but heat underneath
11. Every strike lands harder than it needs to
12. Victor notices - keeps watching Korede while directing civilians
13. Leah fights beside him, matching his energy - mirror/warning
14. Ben runs defense from slightly back, adjusting chokepoints

**The Victory:**
15. First wave repelled
16. Civilians streaming toward fallback zone
17. Minimal casualties on their side
18. Chokepoints holding, evacuation routes open

**Aftermath:**
19. Korede standing among bodies - human-looking but black-eyed
20. Feels not better, not satisfied, but *functional*
21. Rage still coiled, but it did what he needed

**Victor:** "You good?"
**Korede:** "I'm standing."
**Victor:** "That's not what I asked."
*Korede doesn't answer.*

### CONSEQUENCES SEEDED:

- Leash held THIS time - but slipping
- More waves coming
- Victor watching, concerned
- Leah matching his energy (potential enabler or warning)
- Ben's tactics working, but for how long?

## SCENE 4: Eidolon Embodied

**Touchpoint:** Antagonist layer - Eidolon experiences humanity for the first time
**Characters:** Eidolon (POV), clone commanders
**Location:** Behind clone army lines, overlooking the assault

**TTRPG Results:**
- Roll: 2 (Complication) - Sees what he expected, but body betrays him

### STORY BEATS:

**Setup:**
1. Eidolon has always been fear itself - formless, feeding on terror
2. Now in clone avatar body - first time with flesh, nerves, sensation
3. Watching first wave get repelled
4. Watching his forces die, humans fight back

**The Cowardice (Confirmation):**
5. Crush at evacuation point - too many bodies, not enough exits
6. Man shoves elderly woman down to get past
7. Mother loses grip on child's hand, keeps running anyway
8. "Yes. This is what they are."

**The Cruelty (Confirmation):**
9. Sees Korede - the young one fighting with rage beyond necessity
10. Can *taste* the rage even in dulled human form
11. Resistance fighters enjoying it - permission to kill without guilt
12. "They're no different from us. Just weaker."

**THE COMPLICATION - Body Betrays Him:**
13. Hands shaking. Heart slamming. Moisture on palms.
14. He's *afraid*
15. Not of battle - of being IN THIS BODY
16. The vulnerability of flesh
17. Clone soldier nearby takes bullet - Eidolon *flinches*
18. Feeling echo of it, imagining it in his own meat
19. This is what humans live with every moment
20. This fragile, screaming cage of tissue

**The Worse Horror:**
21. He hates them for living like this and still fighting
22. And worse - watching mother lose child in crowd
23. Something *twists* in his chest
24. Not satisfaction. Something else. Something he refuses to name.

**His Response (Doubling Down):**
25. "Weakness. The body's weakness. Nothing more."
26. Shoves it down. Buries it. But it happened.

**Conclusion (Hardened):**
27. "Humanity is disease. They've infected me already."
28. "I need to end this quickly - before this body makes me one of them."

### CONSEQUENCES SEEDED:

- Eidolon has a crack - one flash of something like empathy
- But he's SUPPRESSING it, not exploring it
- Each human sensation makes him hate humanity MORE
- NO REDEMPTION ARC - hardening makes him more dangerous
- Wants war ended fast, before body changes him further
- Sets up his retreat at convergence and Rogue's Gallery building
