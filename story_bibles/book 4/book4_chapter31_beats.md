- Collaborate on quantum beacon modification (morse code only)
- Send message: "SOS + coordinates + OPEN RIFT"
- Earth team receives signal, debates opening rift (unverified, supernova risk)
- Choose faith - open rift but don't cross (too dangerous)
- Rift opens but no rescue party comes through
- Both plan to run to rift together in Pio
- Kaiju pack returns - multiple enemies blocking path
- Rift closing in minutes, can't reach it in time
- Suzie improvises: Harpoon + ejector seat
- Straps Ahdia into co-pilot seat, connects harpoon to rift
- Ejects Ahdia against her will
- Ahdia rockets toward rift on ejector seat
- Visor dies during flight: 1% → 0%
- All AR-Ryu data ERASED mid-flight
- Suzie turns Pio to face kaiju: last stand
- Ahdia crosses rift threshold to Earth
- Powers return immediately
- Freezes self to stop momentum
- Lands safely using temporal control
- Team receives her: joy turning to grief
- Must explain double loss with no proof
- Dead visor only evidence
- Suzie left behind, fate unknown
- Only Ahdia's memories remain

**Character Status:**
- **Ahdia**: Survived, home, powers restored - but carrying double grief and survivor's guilt
- **Suzie**: Sacrificed escape for Ahdia, fate unknown - likely dead fighting kaiju
- **Pio**: Fighting with Suzie, final stand
- **AR-Ryu**: Dead, all data erased - exists only in Ahdia's memory
- **Ryu**: Received Ahdia but not AR-Ryu's data
- **Ruth**: Relief at rescue but recognizing Ahdia's trauma
- **Diana**: Learning about Iteration 3 survivor - guilt compounding
- **Team**: Complete but knowing the cost

**Key Relationships:**
- Ahdia ↔ Suzie: Brief but profound bond, ended in forced sacrifice
- Ahdia ↔ AR-Ryu: Love lost twice (death, then data erasure)
- Ahdia ↔ Ryu: Can't give him AR-Ryu's feelings, only her word
- Ahdia ↔ Ruth: Best friend sees her pain
- Team ↔ Ahdia: Reunited but she's fundamentally changed
- Diana ↔ Iteration 3: Guilt about erased timeline personified

**Thematic Focus:**
- Loss compounding loss
- Impossible choices under pressure
- Heroic sacrifice (Suzie)
- Ephemeral nature of AR existence
- Memory vs proof
- Survivor's guilt
- "Learn to be enough" - Ahdia survives and uses powers, but at terrible cost
- Price of survival
- Found family (Suzie) and lost family
- Faith without verification (Earth team opening rift)

**Losses:**
- AR-Ryu (died in Scene 1)
- AR-Ryu's visor data (erased Scene 18)
- His last words to Ryu (lost forever)
- Suzie Rivets (sacrificed herself Scene 17)
- Iteration 3 representation (only Suzie, now gone)
- Pio (final stand)
- Proof of what happened (only Ahdia's memories remain)
- Harpoon (used for ejection)
- Trust (Suzie "betrayed" Ahdia by ejecting her)

**What Survives:**
- Ahdia (alive, home, powers restored)
- Her memories of AR-Ryu
- Her memories of Suzie
- Stories only she can tell
- Dead visor (empty shell, no data)
- Ejector seat (landed with her)
- Guilt and grief
- But no evidence, no recordings, no proof

**Emotional Weight:**
- AR-Ryu's "Tell him I loved her" never delivered with proof
- Ahdia must tell Ryu herself, no recording to verify
- Suzie from erased timeline, now doubly erased (world + her)
- No one will know Iteration 3 except through Ahdia's stories
- Pio's final stand unwitnessed
- Triple grief: watched AR-Ryu die, data erased mid-flight, forced to abandon Suzie
- Survivor's guilt: lived because others sacrificed
- Ejection = forced survival, couldn't choose to stay
- Bittersweet victory: rescued but broken
- "Something that matters" - Suzie's words haunt

**Setup for Later:**
- Ahdia must tell Ryu what AR-Ryu said (no proof)
- Must explain Suzie and Iteration 3 to Diana (confrontation)
- Processing triple loss
- Survivor's guilt arc (two sacrifices for her survival)
- Team helping her heal
- No physical evidence of either loss
- Dead visor as hollow reminder
- Ejector seat potentially repurposed
- Harpoon principle (if recovered) could inspire tech

**Technical Details:**
- Visor: Real-time AR processing, no memory storage, volatile data
- Beacon: Morse code + binary patterns, quantum frequency
- Mother FAERIS: Received and decoded signal
- Rift: Opened by artificial sun (dying star energy)
- Supernova danger: Limited time window for rift
- Ejector seat: Fighter jet style, explosive launch
- Harpoon: Anchor line for trajectory guidance
- Temporal freeze: Stopped momentum mid-air on Earth side
- Powers: Fully restored upon crossing to Earth dimension

**Earth Team's Leap of Faith:**
- Received cryptic morse signal
- No verification possible
- Could be trap, could be Ahdia, could be anything
- Chose to open rift based on hope alone
- Didn't send people through (too risky)
- Limited time window (supernova danger)
- Watched and waited
- Saw ejector seat emerge
- Recognized Ahdia
- Faith rewarded but at cost

**The Tragedy:**
- Ahdia rescued but carries ghost stories
- AR-Ryu existed only through visor, now gone completely
- Suzie existed in erased timeline, sacrificed for someone she just met
- Both reduced to Ahdia's memories
- No one can verify her stories
- Must live with knowing she's the only witness
- "He said he loved you" - Ryu will never know for sure
- "She was from Iteration 3" - Diana will never face her
- Two people erased from existence
- Only Ahdia remembers

**Suzie's Final Act:**
- Saved harpoon "for something that matters"
- That something = Ahdia's life
- Callback lands perfectly
- Ejected her against her will (couldn't let her choose to stay)
- "Tell them about Iteration 3"
- Turned to face impossible odds
- Gave Ahdia future she'll never have
- From erased world, erased herself
- Heroic and heartbreaking
