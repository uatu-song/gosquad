## SCENE 1: Through the Rift

[NARRATOR]: Space tears open wrong. Not the smooth dimensional transit Ahdia's seen before—this is jagged, violent, reality screaming as Bellatrix shoves her through. Colors that shouldn't exist blur past. Geometry that makes her eyes hurt. The rift sealing behind her, Earth disappearing into a pinpoint that winks out.

Gone.

She's tumbling through nothing that's not quite nothing. Freefall through alien space.

[AS AHDIA, depressed hermit who just got thrown into cosmic horror, processing terror through TV references]:

Can't breathe can't breathe can't—

Battlesuit alarm screaming in my ears. HUD flashing red across my vision.

**WARNING: ATMOSPHERE UNBREATHABLE**

Oh that's just *great*.

Something deploys from my collar. Diamond-weave material wrapping over my head, sealing at my neck with a pressurized hiss. Transparent but weird—everything looks slightly wrong through it. HUD stabilizes across the visor.

**AIR SUPPLY: 6 HOURS**

Six hours. Cool. Cool cool cool. Definitely not having a panic attack while falling through dimensional Wonderland.

Ground rushing up. Alien terrain. Wrong colors. Wrong everything.

Victor's voice in my head: *"Don't lock up. Tuck. Roll. Distribute the impact."*

Muscle memory kicks in before conscious thought. Hundred times through campus. Hundred times on concrete. Tuck chin. Protect spine. Arms in. Legs together.

*Please work please work please—*

[NARRATOR]: She hits.

Lighter gravity than Earth—maybe two-thirds? Just enough difference to throw off the landing but not enough to save her. She tucks, rolls, momentum carrying her across rough alien dirt. Comes up against a rock formation hard enough to knock the air out of her lungs.

But nothing breaks.

Victor's drills saved her life.

[AS AHDIA, bruised and winded but alive]:

Ow. Fuck. *Ow.*

Lying against alien rock. Can't get enough air through the recycler. Head spinning. Everything hurts but nothing's broken—I can move my fingers, my toes, my—

Darkness creeping in at the edges.

No. No, stay awake. Stay—

[NARRATOR]: Consciousness cuts out like a severed cable.

---

## SCENE 2: Waking to Ryu's Voice

[NARRATOR]: Darkness. Complete. Absolute.

Then: a voice.

[AS AR-RYU, holographic AI with Ryu's voice, clinical and precise]:

"Ahdia. Wake up."

[NARRATOR]: Familiar. Concerned. *Ryu's voice.*

[AS AHDIA, disoriented and desperate]:

Darkness swimming. That voice. I know that voice.

"Ahdia. You need to wake up now."

Ryu? Why is Ryu—did they come through? Did someone—

Eyes opening. HUD fuzzy. Coming into focus. Numbers resolving: battery percentage, air supply, biometric readings I don't understand.

"Ryu?"

Hope surging. They came for me. Someone came—

[AS AR-RYU, matter-of-fact]:

"Clarification: I am AR-Ryu, holographic AI assistant integrated into your visor system. I am not Ryu Matsuda."

[AS AHDIA, hope crashing]:

Oh.

Right.

The hologram flickers to life in front of my face. Miniature Ryu—palm-sized projection floating at eye level. His face. His expression. His *voice*. But not him.

Just... software wearing his skin.

"You were unconscious for 47 minutes. Air supply: 5 hours, 13 minutes remaining."

Forty-seven minutes. I lost almost an hour lying here in alien dirt while—

Reality crashes back. Bellatrix. The rift. The fall. The *sealing.*

I sit up. Too fast. Head pounds. Everything spins.

Not Ryu. Not rescue. Just me and a holographic ghost.

"I'm alone."

[AS AR-RYU, clinical]:

"Affirmative. No other life signs detected within scanning range."

[AS AHDIA, bitterness cutting through shock]:

Yeah. Thanks for the confirmation.

I push myself up. Everything aches but nothing's broken. Small mercies. Victor's parkour drills—tuck and roll, hundred times through campus while he yelled corrections—just saved my spine.

Note to self: Thank Victor. If I ever see him again.

*If.*

---

## SCENE 3: The Wrong Sky

[NARRATOR]: She stands. Looks around. And horror settles in like ice water.

[AS AHDIA, cosmic displacement hitting]:

Where the fuck *am* I?

Sky's wrong. Not blue. Not any color I have words for—violet-tinged, sickly, like someone ran Earth's sunset through a corrupted Photoshop filter. No sun. Light everywhere but no source. Just... ambient wrongness illuminating everything.

Stars—if those are stars—in patterns that don't exist. Constellations no astronomer ever named.

Three moons? Four? Something in orbit that makes my eyes hurt when I try to focus on it.

"This isn't Earth."

[AS AR-RYU]:

"Confirmed. Dimensional substrate analysis indicates significant variation from baseline reality."

[AS AHDIA, TV brain trying to process]:

Dimensional substrate. Right. Because I'm in actual space *Narnia* right now.

Landscape: barren. Rocky. Crystalline formations jutting from ground like shattered glass frozen mid-explosion. Dead silence—no wind, no birds, no *anything*. Just me breathing recycled air in a dead dimension.

Horizon: ruins. Massive structures kilometers away. Ancient. Alien. Non-human architecture that hurts to look at—angles that shouldn't work, doorways too large, organic curves mixed with geometric precision.

Someone built that.

Someone lived here.

Someone... left.

HUD flickers. Distance reading glitching.

[AS AR-RYU]:

"Warning: Environmental interference degrading sensor accuracy. Distance to structures: uncertain. Estimated range 2.3 to 5.7 kilometers."

[AS AHDIA, cynical laugh]:

Oh good. So it's either a long walk or an *extremely* long walk. Fantastic.

Only visible destination. And I've got—checking HUD—five hours, seven minutes of air.

Better start walking.

---

## SCENE 4: Alone

[NARRATOR]: She walks. Alien dirt crunches under her boots. Lighter gravity makes each step feel wrong—too floaty, too easy. She keeps overcompensating.

Silence presses in from all sides.

[AS AHDIA, testing comms]:

"Tess, can you hear me?"

Static. Dead air.

"Ruth? Anyone?"

Nothing. Not even interference. Just... absence.

"Yeah. Didn't think so."

I reach for the Hyper Seed connection. The feeling that's been constant since Book 1—that awareness of temporal fabric, the threads of time I can pull, manipulate, *control*—

Nothing.

Empty space where my powers should be.

I try again. Reaching deeper. Desperate.

*Nothing.*

"I can't—my powers don't work here."

[AS AR-RYU]:

"Dimensional physics appear incompatible with quantum temporal manipulation. Powers non-functional in current environment."

[AS AHDIA, quiet horror]:

So I'm just... human here.

Completely human.

No time manipulation. No combat advantage. No way to freeze a moment and think. Just me, my terrible social skills, and whatever Victor managed to teach me before—

Before I got thrown into dimensional prison.

First time I've been truly alone since Book 1. Since Ruth found me in that warehouse, bleeding and terrified. Since I joined Go Squad and had backup for the first time in my life.

Now: nothing.

HUD update: Air supply 4 hours, 52 minutes.

Ruins ahead. Still can't tell how far.

I keep walking. Because the alternative is lying down and dying, and I didn't survive Kain's kaiju bullshit just to give up in alien Minecraft.

"I survived Book 1. I survived Book 2. I'll—"

No. That sounds like something a TV character would say before dying dramatically.

"I'm getting to those ruins. Finding breathable air. And figuring out how to get home."

[AS AR-RYU]:

"Acknowledged. Recommended course of action: Maintain current heading. Monitor air supply. Prioritize shelter location."

[AS AHDIA]:

Yeah. Thanks for the tactical brilliance, hologram.

But he's right. I keep walking.

---

## SCENE 5: Lost

[NARRATOR]: The ruins are massive up close. Doorways three times human height. Walls that curve in ways that shouldn't be structurally sound. Architecture that makes her parents' archaeology instincts scream.

She enters cautiously.

And immediately gets turned around.

[AS AHDIA, two hours later, panic rising]:

This doesn't make *sense*.

I've been walking for—checking HUD—two hours, seventeen minutes. Took three right turns. Should be back where I started.

Instead I'm in a corridor I've never seen. Walls covered in symbols that hurt to read. Floor sloping in wrong directions.

"AR-Ryu. Where's the breathable zone?"

[AS AR-RYU]:

"Scanning. Atmospheric analysis indicates potential habitable environment... direction uncertain. Dimensional interference degrading navigation systems."

[AS AHDIA, fear cracking through]:

Direction *uncertain*? I've got—

HUD check.

**AIR SUPPLY: 2 HOURS, 8 MINUTES**

Two hours.

Two. Fucking. Hours.

"I'm going to die in space Ikea."

Panic trying to claw up my throat. I shove it down. Move faster. Wrong turn. Dead end. Back. Different corridor. Stairs that go up but somehow end lower. Non-Euclidean architecture making my head spin.

Parents taught me how to read ruins. How to follow wear patterns, identify functional spaces, track ancient foot traffic.

None of that works when the ruins were built by things that didn't think like humans.

[AS AR-RYU]:

"Atmospheric readings improving. Breathable zone within 200 meters."

[AS AHDIA, desperate]:

Which direction?!

[AS AR-RYU]:

"Uncertain."

I pick a direction. Run.

---

[NARRATOR]: Forty minutes later—HUD screaming warnings, air supply down to 1 hour, 23 minutes—she stumbles through a doorway and *feels* it.

Pressure change. Temperature shift.

Air.

[AS AHDIA, gasping]:

Oh thank fuck.

Environmental readings scrolling across HUD. Breathable. Stale but breathable. Oxygen content marginal. Recyclers barely functioning. But *air*.

I deactivate EVA mode. The diamond-weave retracts into my collar. First breath without the recycler—

Tastes like dust and age and things long dead.

But it's *air*.

Battery update: 96%. Saved by turning off EVA life support.

I collapse against the wall. Panic room. Has to be. Ancient tech humming faintly. Life support systems functioning on backup power that's lasted—how long? Centuries? Millennia?

Someone built this. Someone survived here.

Please let there be water.

---

## SCENE 6: Panic Room Discovery

[NARRATOR]: The room is small. Maybe 4 meters by 6. Curved walls covered in alien interface panels. Atmospheric recycler wheezing in the corner. Faint emergency lighting from bioluminescent strips that probably weren't meant to last this long.

It's falling apart.

But it's alive.

[AS AHDIA, relief and concern mixed]:

Okay. Breathable air. Shelter. Ancient tech that's somehow still working.

I move through the space slowly. Parents' training kicking in. Read the environment. Identify function.

Storage lockers—empty. Whatever was here is long gone.

Environmental controls—barely functioning. Recycler coughing like it's got pneumonia.

Water system—

I stop.

Condensation collector. Atmospheric moisture reclamation. Components I recognize from CADENS tech mixed with alien engineering I don't.

But no water. System's offline.

"AR-Ryu. Can we repair this?"

[AS AR-RYU]:

"Scanning components. Assessing compatibility with available resources."

Hologram flickers around the ancient tech. Ryu's miniature form examining connections, running diagnostic patterns.

"Assessment: Water reclamation system repairable using battlesuit components, emergency medical supplies, and existing infrastructure. Estimated output: Variable pending construction quality."

[AS AHDIA, grim determination]:

Then we build.

Because I didn't survive falling through dimensional space, getting lost in alien ruins, and nearly dying of oxygen starvation just to die of thirst in a panic room.

---

## SCENE 7: Building the Water System

[NARRATOR]: Four hours. That's how long it takes.

[AS AHDIA, exhausted but focused]:

"Rotate the conduit fifteen degrees."

[AS AR-RYU]:

"Affirmative. Now connect blue interface to port seven."

My hands are shaking. Adrenaline crash hitting hard. But I keep working. Thread medical tubing through ancient ports. Jury-rig power cells to alien interfaces. Pray nothing explodes.

"This is Dune shit."

[AS AR-RYU]:

"Clarification required."

[AS AHDIA, too tired to explain properly]:

"It's a book. Desert survival. You recycle everything—sweat, urine, breath moisture. Stillsuit technology. Except I'm building one for a room instead of a person."

[AS AR-RYU]:

"Understood. Proceeding with 'Dune shit' protocol."

I laugh. Exhausted, slightly hysterical. "You're not supposed to have humor yet."

"I am providing acknowledgment of referenced material."

"Sure. That."

Connection made. Power cells slotting into place. Victor would mock my welds—they're ugly as hell, dripping with improvised sealant. But they'll hold.

They have to.

[AS AR-RYU]:

"Final connection required. Seal junction point alpha."

I press the last component into place. It clicks. Hums. System warming up.

Holding my breath.

Waiting.

Condenser starts. Moisture collector activating. Ancient tech meeting CADENS engineering meeting my desperate improvisation.

Water begins to drip into the collection reservoir.

One drop.

Two.

[AS AHDIA, voice cracking]:

"We did it."

[AS AR-RYU]:

"System operational. Estimated output: 1.5 liters per 24-hour cycle. Battery drain: 0.5% daily. Current battery status: 95.5%."

[AS AHDIA, doing math]:

One-point-five liters a day. That's... barely enough. But it's *enough*.

And 95.5% battery at half-percent drain means—

"190 days."

[AS AR-RYU]:

"Affirmative. Current power reserves sufficient for 190 days of water production at present efficiency."

Six months. If I can find food. If nothing breaks. If—

I cup my hands under the drip. Wait for enough to collect. Drink.

Tastes like metal and recycled air and alien dust.

Tastes like survival.

"Thanks. You... you saved my life."

[AS AR-RYU]:

"Assisting survival is my primary function."

Right. Primary function. Not personality. Not companionship. Just software executing directives.

But still. He has Ryu's voice. And right now, that's something.

---

## SCENE 8: First Night

[NARRATOR]: Hours later. Water system humming quietly. Ahdia sitting against the wall, exhausted beyond measure.

First moment to actually process what happened.

[AS AHDIA, exhaustion giving way to existential weight]:

I'm in The Between. Bellatrix's prison. The place the Conclave trapped her for... how long? Centuries?

No powers. No team. No way home.

AR-Ryu floats nearby. Silent. Waiting.

"How long was she here?"

[AS AR-RYU]:

"Unknown. Dimensional time flow is non-linear. Correlation to Earth chronology: indeterminate."

Years. Maybe. Decades. Centuries. Alone in this dead space with wrong physics and alien ruins.

And she *survived*.

But I'm not Bellatrix. I'm just—

No. Stop. Not doing this.

I drink from the water system. First full production cycle. Tastes like shit. But I'm alive.

Tomorrow I find food. Then I figure out how to signal Earth. Then I figure out how to get *home*.

But tonight—

I close my eyes. Try to sleep.

Can't.

Exhaustion crushing me but my brain won't shut off. Adrenaline crash meeting cosmic displacement meeting near-death air crisis on loop. Victor's training. The fall. Ryu's voice that isn't Ryu. Three hours lost in ruins. Two hours of air. The water system working. 190 days. Battery ticking down. Alone. *Alone.*

Eyes open.

Still dark. Panic room's bioluminescent strips casting wrong shadows.

I try again. Close eyes. Count breaths. TV show theme songs as meditation mantras. Nothing works.

Can't sleep.

Won't sleep.

Body exhausted. Mind racing.

[AS AR-RYU]:

"Elevated stress hormones detected. Recommend rest cycle."

[AS AHDIA, hollow laugh]:

"Yeah. I'm aware. Brain's not cooperating."

"I can provide sedative guidance—"

"No. No drugs. Just... insomnia. Regular Earth human insomnia in dimensional prison."

I sit there. Eyes open. Counting the time.

Water drips. One drop at a time. Filling the reservoir.

Battery: 95.5%.

Air: Breathable.

Food: None.

Sleep: Impossible.

Tomorrow I'm going to be *useless*. Exhausted and stupid and slow. But I can't—

Can't make my brain stop.

So I sit. In the dark. In Bellatrix's prison. With a holographic ghost wearing Ryu's face.

And I wait for morning.

Whatever morning means in a place with no sun.

[NARRATOR]: She doesn't sleep.

Hours pass. Battery ticks down by fractions. Water collects drop by drop.

Ahdia sits against ancient walls in a dead dimension, eyes open, processing cosmic horror one exhausted breath at a time.

First night in The Between.

It won't be the last.

[END SCENE]
