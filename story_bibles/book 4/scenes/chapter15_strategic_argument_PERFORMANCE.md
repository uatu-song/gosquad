# Chapter 15, Scene 5: The Strategic Argument
## METHOD ACTOR PERFORMANCE TEST

**Scene ID:** book4_ch15_strategic_argument
**Location:** Resistance HQ command room
**Touchpoint A:** Ruth presents rescue plan after signal detection
**Touchpoint B:** Coalition splits - Ruth proceeds, Korede stays

---

[NARRATOR]: The command room feels smaller with everyone present. Days after defeating the clone army, the team should be celebrating. Instead, they're arguing. Mother FAERIS's holographic display still shows the signal data—artificial transmission from The Between, 0.003% strength, source unknown. Ruth stands at the head of the table, Diana beside her with calculations spread across a tablet. Ben, Victor, and Tess sit together, exhausted from weeks of guerrilla warfare. Korede leans against the wall near resistance leaders, arms crossed, jaw tight.

Ruth has just finished explaining the plan. Rescue Ahdia. Use the international artificial sun facility. Risk everything on a signal they can't even decode.

The silence stretches.

---

[AS KOREDE, 17-year-old resistance tactician, grieving brother who lost Leta in Book 2, protective of civilians]:

I look around the table. At Ben's split knuckles. At Victor's bandaged shoulder. At the exhaustion on every face. We just survived the clone war. _Just_ survived. And now—

"We lost how many defending this city?" My voice cuts through the quiet. "Now you want to abandon them for one person?"

Ruth's eyes find mine. Direct. Unwavering.

I push off the wall. "TRIOMF is still active. Kain controls CADENS. Bellatrix is _somewhere_. I'm defending civilian evacuation routes every single day—sometimes twice a day—and you want me to stop for this?"

"It's not one person," Ben starts, but I'm not done.

"It's a _signal_," I say. "Artificial pattern. Could be anything. Could be Bellatrix baiting us into exactly this—abandoning the people we're supposed to protect."

I look at Diana's mathematics on the tablet. Fusion collapse mechanics. Four-minute window. Supernova risk.

"A million lives if it goes wrong," I say quietly. "Against one we're not even sure is alive."

---

[AS RUTH, trauma surgeon and Go Squad leader, fierce protector who won't abandon family]:

I don't flinch when Korede's eyes meet mine. I understand his position. I do. But understanding doesn't change what needs to happen.

"She's family," I say. Simple. Direct. "We don't leave family behind."

"Family," Korede repeats, something sharp in his voice. "I had family. Leta died two years ago defending civilians from Kain's operation. Remember?"

The room goes silent.

I hold his gaze. "I remember. I was there. I tried to save her." My hands are steady on the table—medical discipline, years of it. "And I'm sorry. But that doesn't change this."

"Doesn't change—" Korede starts.

"That signal is someone," I cut him off. "Maybe Ahdia. Maybe not. But someone is transmitting from The Between, from the exact coordinates Diana calculated, and you want me to ignore it because it's _inconvenient_?"

"Inconvenient?" Korede's voice rises. "I'm watching people die. Every. Single. Day. While I hold evacuation routes against clone avatars and CADENS patrols. That's not inconvenient. That's my _mission_."

"And she's mine."

---

[AS BEN, former cop and military tactician, evidence-based investigator siding with Ruth]:

I've been listening. Watching. Ruth's certainty. Korede's grief. Both valid. Both impossible to reconcile.

"If it's her," I say quietly, "we have to try."

Korede wheels on me. "Based on _what_, Ben? Mathematics? Diana's calculations support dimensional origin—great. Mathematics don't fight clone avatars while I'm protecting people."

"No," I agree. "They don't. But that signal—"

"Could be anything!"

"—is artificial," I finish. "Someone sent it. From exactly where Diana said The Between would be accessible."

I lean forward, elbows on the table. Former cop instincts, evidence-based thinking. "The pattern is non-random. The origin matches theoretical coordinates. The timing is days after we saw Bellatrix throw Ahdia through a rift."

"Circumstantial," Korede says.

"All evidence is circumstantial until you act on it." I look at Ruth. "If there's a chance it's her, we can't ignore it."

"Even if it risks a million lives?" Korede demands.

I don't answer immediately. Because he's right. The risk is enormous. Fusion collapse, four-minute window, supernova danger. Regional catastrophe if we're wrong.

But Ahdia saved my life. Multiple times. And Ruth won't abandon her. I know that look.

"Yes," I say finally. "Even then."

---

[AS DIANA, Ahdia Prime from erased timeline, 43 iterations of timeline experience, weary but precise]:

They're arguing passion against pragmatism. Faith against strategy. I've seen this debate 43 times across different timelines. It always feels the same.

"The mathematics support dimensional origin," I say when there's a pause. Clinical. Precise. "Signal frequency matches theoretical substrate resonance. Propagation delay consistent with dimensional barrier penetration. Source location within 0.2% of my calculated coordinates."

Korede looks at me. "And the risk?"

I don't sugarcoat it. "Fusion reactor collapse creates localized stellar event. Four-minute window before runaway cascade. If the rift destabilizes during that window—" I gesture to Mother FAERIS's display showing blast radius projections. "1.2 million estimated casualties within initial radius. Secondary effects unknown."

"Unknown," Korede repeats.

"This has never been attempted." I meet his eyes. I'm older than everyone here by subjective decades. I carry timeline weight they can't imagine. "I can calculate probabilities. I cannot guarantee safety."

"Then why—"

"Because she's in there." I cut him off quietly. "That signal is coming from The Between. I know that space. I know what it takes to survive there. And someone is trying to reach us."

Victor shifts in his seat. "You can't know it's Ahdia."

"No," I agree. "But I know what it means if it is, and we ignore it."

---

[AS VICTOR, environmental organizer and both/and teacher, sees complexity in all positions]:

I've been watching everyone. Ruth's fierce determination. Korede's protective defensiveness. Ben's torn loyalty. Diana's weary certainty. Tess beside me, silent but anxious.

This is both/and territory. Multiple valid truths.

"Korede is right," I say.

Everyone turns to me.

"Civilians need defending. TRIOMF is active. Kain and Bellatrix are out there. The resistance is stretched thin. Walking away from that to chase a maybe—it's a terrible strategic choice."

Korede nods sharply.

"Ruth is also right."

His expression hardens.

"If that signal is Ahdia, and we don't try—" I spread my hands. "We're abandoning family. Someone who's saved how many lives? Who threw herself into danger for us repeatedly?"

"Both," I say. "Both positions matter. Both are valid. This isn't good choice versus bad choice. It's necessary choice versus necessary choice."

"That's not helpful, Victor," Korede says.

"No," I agree. "It's not. But it's true."

I look at Ruth. Then at Korede. "You're both doing what you have to. Community networks matter—that's what I've always taught. But Korede, your community is the civilians under fire. Ruth, your community is Go Squad. Different responsibilities. Different truths."

"So what do we do?" Tess asks quietly beside me.

"We choose," I say simply. "And we live with it."

---

[AS TESS, Gen Z hacker, loyal but anxious, father issues driving her choices]:

I've been quiet this whole time. Listening. Processing. My shoulder still aches from the Book 3 ending—Bellatrix's attack, watching Ahdia disappear through that rift.

My FAERIS stayed loyal when all others turned. I still don't know why. But that mystery feels connected to this somehow.

"Ahdia saved my life," I say. Everyone looks at me. "Multiple times. When my father—" I stop. Don't go there. "She was there when no one else was."

Korede's expression softens slightly. "Tess—"

"I know your position is valid," I interrupt. "I _know_. Civilians are dying. We're exhausted. The resistance needs everyone. But—"

My voice cracks slightly. "But she didn't leave me behind. Not when it was dangerous. Not when it was stupid. Not when everyone else would have."

I look at Ruth. Then at Korede. "I don't know if that signal is her. Could be a trap. Could be Bellatrix playing us. Could be nothing."

"But if it _is_ her," I continue, "and we're sitting here debating resource allocation while she's alone in The Between—"

I can't finish. Because I know what my father would say. Calculate the cost. Weigh the strategic value. Make the rational choice.

And I know what Ahdia would do. She'd go. No hesitation.

"I'm with Ruth," I say quietly.

---

[AS RUTH, trauma surgeon and Go Squad leader, making the hard call]:

The room is silent after Tess speaks. I can see the lines being drawn. Ben, Victor, Tess—they're with me. Diana's calculations support us. Ryu will follow where Mother FAERIS guides.

Korede stands alone. Well—not alone. The resistance leaders behind him. But separated from us.

I look at him. Really look. Seventeen years old. Lost his sister. Defending civilians every day while we chased cosmic threats. His position isn't wrong. It's _necessary_ for him.

And mine is necessary for me.

"Then stay," I say. Not angry. Not dismissive. Understanding. "We'll go."

His eyes widen slightly. "Ruth—"

"You're needed here," I continue. "Civilians need defending. Evacuation routes need protecting. TRIOMF needs monitoring. You're right about all of it."

I stand straighter. Medical precision. "But that signal is someone. And I won't abandon them. So we'll go to the facility. We'll convince them to help. We'll open that rift and bring whoever's transmitting home."

"And if it's a trap?" Korede asks.

"Then we'll deal with it." I look around the table. At my coalition forming. "CADENS waits. They hesitate, they calculate, they're always too late. Go Squad go. That's the pattern. That's who we are."

"Even if you're wrong?" Korede presses.

"Even then."

The words hang in the air. Final. Irrevocable.

Korede looks at me for a long moment. I see the conflict in his eyes. Wanting to help. Knowing he can't justify it. Grief and duty pulling opposite directions.

"Then I'm staying," he says finally. "My post is here. Defending people who can't defend themselves."

"I know," I say softly.

"Don't ask me to abandon them."

"I won't."

The split is happening. Painful. Necessary. Both of us doing what we have to.

"But don't ask me to abandon her either," I finish.

Korede nods slowly. No animosity. No anger. Just two people with different responsibilities making different choices.

"When do you leave?" he asks.

"Morning," I say. "Ruth, Diana, Ben, Victor, Tess, Ryu. We'll reach the facility and convince them to help."

"Good luck," Korede says. And he means it.

"You too," I reply. Because he'll need it. Holding Caledonia against TRIOMF and Kain without us.

The meeting breaks. Coalition formed. Opposition clear. Split complete.

Ruth's team will pursue the rescue. Korede stays to defend civilians. Both choices matter. Both are valid.

CADENS waits. Go Squad go.
