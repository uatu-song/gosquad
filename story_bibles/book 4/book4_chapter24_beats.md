# Chapter 24: Infiltration

**Timeline:** Earth (Ruth's Quest)
**Touchpoints:** H2 (Infiltration) + H3 (Descent)
**TTRPG Rolls:** 10, 10 (Critical Success, Critical Success)
**Location:** CADENS HQ - Surface through Sub-Level 2

---

## Scene Type
Stealth / Infiltration

## Characters Present
- Ruth Carter (leader)
- Ryu Tanaka (the package - wake protocol carrier)
- Tess Whitford (tech, FAERIS awareness)
- Jericho (inside man, guide)
- Diana (with team - can't use powers, Bellatrix knowledge)

---

## Core Dynamic

Three operators protecting one scientist, guided by someone who can't use her greatest asset. Ryu isn't a field agent - he's the brains, the wake protocol carrier, the essential cargo. Diana has power she can't touch without alerting Bellatrix. The crits aren't any one person being heroic - they're the team being competent together, each contributing what they can.

---

## Story Beats

### Beat 1: Approach
- Team arrives at CADENS perimeter
- Titan Strategic corporate facade - normal office building
- Jericho: "Stay calm. We're technicians here for excavation support. That's all."
- Ryu already looks nervous
- Ruth, quiet: "Breathe."

### Beat 2: Surface Entry (Jericho's Moment)
- Badge readers at entrance
- Jericho hands out credentials - everything pre-arranged
- Security guard glances at badges, waves them through
- Jericho nods, professional, like he's done this a hundred times
- They're in

### Beat 3: The Facade
- Inside Titan Strategic - normal corporate environment
- Real employees who don't know what's below
- The team walks through like they belong
- Ryu's eyes darting - Ruth touches his arm, steadies him
- "Eyes forward. You're bored. This is routine."

### Beat 4: Hidden Elevator (Tess's First Moment)
- Jericho leads them to "maintenance closet"
- Hidden elevator behind it
- Biometric scanner - Jericho clears it
- But Tess pauses: "Wait."
- She senses something - FAERIS drone sweep nearby
- "Ten seconds." They freeze.
- Drone passes. Clear.
- They enter elevator.

### Beat 5: Sub-Level 1 - Operations (Ruth's Moment)
- Elevator opens to CADENS operations center
- Busy. People everywhere. Monitors, workstations, uniforms.
- This is the gauntlet - most eyes, highest exposure
- Ryu freezes at the threshold
- Ruth, calm: "You're a technician. You've done this before. Walk."
- She puts a hand on his back, guides him forward
- They move through the crowd, Jericho leading, Ruth shepherding Ryu
- No one looks twice

### Beat 6: Almost Blown (Ryu's Weakness, Tess Covers)
- Someone calls out: "Hey—"
- Ryu stiffens. Almost turns.
- Tess, without breaking stride, steps in front of him
- It's not for them - someone else, across the room
- Tess: "Keep walking."
- Ryu exhales. Too close.
- Ruth's hand on his back again: "You're doing fine."

### Beat 7: Sub-Level 2 Access (Tess's Second Moment)
- Research level entrance
- Badge + rotating code + sign-in log
- Jericho handles credentials
- But the panel glitches - red light
- Tess steps in, calm: "Move."
- She does something quick - bypass, override, something technical
- Green light. They're through.
- Jericho: "Impressive."
- Tess, flat: "I know FAERIS systems. This is FAERIS-adjacent."

### Beat 8: Research Level Transit (Diana's Moment)
- Labs, server rooms, technical equipment
- Quieter than Sub-Level 1, but more scrutiny if stopped
- A researcher looks up, frowning - something off about the group
- Diana steps forward, meets his eyes, calm: "We're behind schedule. The excavation team is waiting."
- Her tone isn't threatening. Just certain. Three universes of reading people.
- The researcher nods, looks away. Not his problem.
- They move on. Ryu exhales.
- Ruth, quiet: "How did you—"
- Diana: "He wanted someone to tell him it was fine. I told him."

### Beat 9: Sub-Level 3 Elevator
- They reach the excavation level access
- Elevator ahead - this is the hard part
- Clone checkpoint visible
- Jericho: "This is as far as smooth gets us."
- Ruth looks at the team: "Ready?"
- Beat. They're in deep now. No turning back.

---

## Emotional Beats

- **Opening:** Controlled tension - executing the plan
- **Middle:** Near-misses absorbed by competence
- **Closing:** Arrival at the real challenge - clone checkpoint ahead

---

## Consequences

- Successfully infiltrated through Sub-Level 2
- Team dynamic established: three operators, one package
- Ryu's vulnerability clear - he's essential but fragile in the field
- Tess's FAERIS connection foreshadowed (drone awareness, system knowledge)
- Jericho's competence on full display (reads heroic now, sinister on reread)
- Next obstacle: clone checkpoint (Chapter 26)

---

## Tension
Steady/High - Things going right doesn't mean relaxed. Every smooth moment feels like borrowed time.

---

## What Could Happen Next
1. Between chapter with Ahdia (Chapter 25)
2. Clone checkpoint - H4 (Chapter 26)
3. Korede's storyline intercutting

---

## Notes

**Why crits feel tense:** Diana's warnings echo. Every success feels like "too easy." The team is waiting for the trap. It doesn't come - yet.

**Jericho's performance:** Flawless. Helpful. Competent. Exactly what you'd want from an inside man. On reread: he's guiding them exactly where he needs them to be.

**Ryu as package:** He's not incompetent - he's just not trained for this. His value is the wake protocol in his head. The team's job is to get him to Mother FAERIS alive and functional.

**Tess foreshadowing:** Her FAERIS awareness - sensing drones, knowing systems - sets up her drone recognizing her in Chapter 31.

**Diana's role:** She's physically present but can't use her powers - Bellatrix would sense any temporal manipulation instantly. Her value is three universes of reading people, knowing Bellatrix's patterns, unshakeable calm. The silent cost: she watches them struggle with problems she could solve in a heartbeat if she touched her power.

**Status:** Beat sheet complete. Ready for prose or TTRPG rolling.
