# The Between Arc - Nexus Points

**Purpose**: Define non-negotiable story beats that MUST happen vs. emergent elements determined by TTRPG gameplay.

---

## NEXUS POINTS (Non-Negotiable)

These are fixed destinations based on Chapter 31 (already written):

### 1. Starting Conditions
- **Location**: Ahdia stranded in The Between (end of Book 3 Ch 19)
- **Companion**: AR-Ryu (visor AI, based on real Ryu's personality)
- **Status**: Dimensional gateway sealed behind her, no way back
- **Visor**: 100% battery at start

### 2. Captain Suzie Rivets (MUST be encountered)
- **Identity**: Mech pilot from Iteration 3 (Timeline Gamma)
- **Callsign**: "Troublemaker"
- **Mech**: Pio (two-seater combat chassis, battle-scarred)
- **Background**: Fell through dimensional rift during Bellatrix's destruction of Iteration 3
- **Personality**: Established in Chapter 31 - irreverent humor, engineer skills, loyal

### 3. The Quantum Beacon (MUST be attempted)
- **Goal**: Send signal to Earth (Timeline Epsilon/current)
- **Method**: Quantum beacon using morse code
- **Message**: (TBD but must be recognizable to Earth team)
- **Collaboration**: Ahdia + Suzie work together to build/activate it
- **Success**: Signal IS received by Earth team

### 4. The Escape Sequence (Chapter 31 - already written)
- **Trigger**: Earth team opens rift using artificial sun facility
- **Obstacle**: Kaiju pack blocks escape route
- **Sacrifice**: Suzie ejects Ahdia through rift using Pio's harpoon
- **Cost**: Visor battery dies mid-flight → AR-Ryu data permanently erased
- **Outcome**: Ahdia crosses to Earth, powers return, lands safely
- **Suzie's fate**: Stays behind for last stand, rift seals

## EMERGENT ELEMENTS (TTRPG Determines)

These should arise naturally from gameplay, dice rolls, and player choices:

### Survival Challenges
- **Water source**: How/when does she find water? Complications?
- **Food source**: What (if anything) is edible in The Between?
- **Shelter**: Where does she establish base camp?
- **Threats**: What dangers does she face? Kaiju? Environment? Other?

### The Between Environment
- **Physics**: How does this dimension work? (gravity? time? atmosphere?)
- **Geography**: What does the landscape look like?
- **Inhabitants**: What lives here besides kaiju? (if anything)
- **History**: Any evidence of previous civilizations/visitors?
- **Rules**: What are the dimensional laws governing this space?

### Meeting Suzie
- **When**: How many days into Ahdia's isolation?
- **How**: What circumstances bring them together?
- **Suzie's condition**: Injured? Desperate? What does she need?
- **Pio's status**: Damaged? Functional? What needs repair?
- **Initial dynamic**: Trust? Suspicion? Immediate rapport?

### The Journey Together
- **Discoveries**: What do they learn about The Between?
- **Challenges**: What obstacles do they face?
- **Resources**: What tools/materials do they find?
- **Relationship**: How does their partnership develop?
- **Other encounters**: Do they meet anyone/anything else?

### Quantum Beacon Details
- **Location**: Where do they attempt the signal?
- **Technology**: What components are needed?
- **Power source**: How do they power it?
- **Complications**: What goes wrong during construction/activation?
- **Costs**: What price do they pay to send the signal?

### Before the Escape
- **Visor degradation**: How much battery remains by Chapter 31?
- **Ahdia's condition**: Injuries? Exhaustion? Psychological state?
- **Bond with Suzie**: How deep is their friendship by the end?
- **AR-Ryu's state**: Any changes to the AI before deletion?

## TTRPG APPROACH

### Starting Scenario
**Day 0**: Ahdia emerges in The Between, gateway seals behind her. AR-Ryu initializes. What does she do?

### Key Decision Points (Dice-Driven)
- Exploration vs staying put
- Risk assessment for survival needs
- Investigation of strange phenomena
- Combat/evasion when threats appear
- Resource management (visor battery, physical stamina)
- Social interaction if NPCs exist

### Success/Failure Consequences
- **Success**: Finds resources easily, avoids danger, makes progress
- **Partial success**: Achieves goal but with complications/costs
- **Failure**: Complications arise, must adapt, new problems emerge
- **Critical failure**: Serious setback, injury, resource loss

### Tracking Systems
- **Visor battery**: Drains with usage (tracking, scanning, AR functions)
- **Physical condition**: Hunger, thirst, exhaustion, injuries
- **Psychological state**: Isolation effects, stress, determination
- **Time passage**: Days in The Between (affects all above)
- **Resources**: Water, food, tools, discovered items

## RUNNING THE CAMPAIGN

1. **Start at Day 0** (Ahdia just stranded)
2. **Player declares intent** (what does Ahdia do?)
3. **Roll for outcome** (skill checks based on action)
4. **Apply consequences** (success/failure affects situation)
5. **Track resources** (battery, stamina, supplies)
6. **Introduce complications** (based on failures or random events)
7. **Repeat** until natural meeting with Suzie emerges
8. **Continue** through beacon construction and to Chapter 31 events

## QUESTIONS FOR TTRPG TO ANSWER

- How long is Ahdia alone before meeting Suzie?
- What survival skills does she develop?
- What does she discover about The Between?
- Who/what does she encounter besides Suzie?
- What state is she in (physically/mentally) when they meet?
- Why does Suzie need Ahdia's help specifically?
- What do they build the beacon from?
- How many attempts does the beacon take?
- What costs do they pay for success?
- What is their final conversation before the escape?

---

**Next Step**: Run TTRPG campaign from Day 0, let story emerge naturally toward nexus point of meeting Suzie.
