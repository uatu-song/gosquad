## Chapter 15 Summary (REVISED)

**Major Events:**
- Team arrives at international artificial sun facility
- Diana briefs scientists on dimensional rift theory
- Mother FAERIS provides technical data and credibility
- SHOCKING: Weak transmission signal detected from The Between
- Signal is artificial but too weak to decode
- Location matches theoretical coordinates for The Between
- Debate: Could be Ahdia, could be trap, could be anything
- Director explains risks: 4-minute window, supernova danger, regional catastrophe
- Ruth advocates for faith: "That signal is a person. My family."
- **Director DENIES authorization** - needs 24 hours to decide
- Chapter ends: Team waiting, uncertain, signal still transmitting

**Character Status:**
- **Ruth**: Advocated for impossible choice - faith over certainty (denied)
- **Diana**: Technical advisor, supporting Ruth's position
- **Team**: United in desperate hope, now frustrated by delay
- **Director**: Refusing to authorize without certainty

**Key Relationships:**
- Ruth ↔ Ahdia: Won't abandon her, chooses faith
- Team ↔ Ruth: Trust her leadership despite denial
- Ruth ↔ Director: Trying to convince him, failing

**Thematic Focus:**
- Faith vs certainty
- Personal loyalty vs public safety
- Hope as radical choice (deferred)
- Love worth impossible risk (risk not yet taken)
- Trust without proof (challenged)

**Setup for Next:**
- **BRAIDED TIMELINE STRUCTURE begins**
- **Chapter 16**: FLASHBACK - "The Between, Two Weeks Earlier" (Ahdia POV)
- **Chapter 17**: Earth timeline - Ruth's crisis continues (Earth POV)
- Alternating chapters build parallel tension
- Chapters 16-30: Dual timelines converge
- Chapter 31: Present moment - Rift opens, escape sequence

**Dramatic Stakes:**
- Signal is TRANSMITTING right now
- But rift is NOT open yet
- Authorization uncertain
- Reader knows: Someone is sending that signal
- But WHO? And will Earth team open rift in time?
- Two timelines racing toward convergence
