**Timeline:** Earth (Ruth's Quest)
**Touchpoint:** H4 - Clone Checkpoint
**TTRPG Roll:** 8 (Success - tight)
**Location:** Sub-Level 3 access - Excavation level entrance

---

## Scene Type
Stealth / Combat

## Characters Present
- Ruth Carter (leader, combat)
- Ryu Tanaka (the package - stays back)
- Tess Whitford (combat, stealth)
- Jericho (hangs back)
- Diana (watches, can't use powers)

---

## Core Dynamic

Credentials won't work here. These are Bellatrix's forces, not CADENS personnel. The only way through is violence. Ruth and Tess are the operators. Everyone else stays back.

---

## Story Beats

### Beat 1: The Checkpoint
- Sub-Level 3 elevator access
- Clone checkpoint ahead - two guards visible, armed
- Different energy than CADENS security - military, alert
- Jericho, quiet: "My credentials won't work here. They're Bellatrix's."
- The smooth part of the infiltration is over

### Beat 2: Assessment
- Ruth studies the checkpoint
- Ruth: "How many?"
- Tess, already scanning: "Two visible. Alcove on the right - could be a third."
- Jericho: "I can try to talk—"
- Ruth: "No. They'll check. We don't have time for questions."
- Decision made

### Beat 3: Positioning
- Ruth to Ryu: "Stay behind Diana. Don't move until I say."
- Ryu, pale: "What are you—"
- Ruth and Tess exchange a look. No discussion needed.
- Diana, quiet: "Do what she says."
- Jericho steps back. Out of the way.

### Beat 4: The Approach
- Ruth and Tess walk toward the checkpoint
- Casual. Like they belong.
- Clone guard raises a hand: "Hold. Credentials."
- Ruth keeps walking. Tess drifts right, toward the alcove.
- Guard's hand moves toward his weapon: "I said—"

### Beat 5: The Takedown
- Ruth closes the distance. Fast.
- First guard down before he can draw - throat strike, knee to gut, controlled fall
- Tess takes the second - behind him, arm around neck, silent
- Three seconds. Maybe four.
- Professional. Brutal. Necessary.

### Beat 6: The Third Clone (The Tight Part)
- Movement from the alcove. Tess was right.
- Third clone coming around the corner, weapon rising
- Tess spins, releases the second guard, moves
- Too slow? No - just fast enough
- Clone goes down. But his hand was on the comm.
- Tess checks: "He didn't transmit. Close."
- Too close.

### Beat 7: Aftermath
- Three clones down. Quiet.
- Ruth breathing hard. Controlled.
- Tess checking bodies - weapons, comms, anything useful
- Ryu staring at the bodies. He's never seen Ruth like this.
- Diana unmoved. Watching. Three universes of violence behind those eyes.

### Beat 8: Jericho's Moment
- Jericho steps forward, over the bodies
- Doesn't look down. Doesn't flinch.
- "Nice work."
- Two words. No affect.
- Keeps walking toward the elevator.
- (On reread: cold. Calculating. He let them do the violence while he stayed clean.)

### Beat 9: The Cost
- Ruth's hand is bleeding - caught on something, a blade, armor edge
- She wraps it without comment. Field dressing. Keeps moving.
- Tess: "You good?"
- Ruth: "I'm fine."
- She's not talking about the hand.

### Beat 10: Forward
- Path to Mother FAERIS is clear
- Elevator ahead
- Ryu still hasn't moved
- Diana touches his shoulder: "Come on. We're not done."
- He follows. Something shifted in how he sees Ruth.
- They descend.

---

## Emotional Beats

- **Opening:** Tension - end of the smooth part
- **Middle:** Violence - quick, necessary, ugly
- **Closing:** Quiet aftermath - something changed

---

## Consequences

- Checkpoint cleared - path to Mother FAERIS open
- Ruth and Tess revealed as capable of violence
- Ryu sees the team differently now
- Jericho stayed clean (significant on reread)
- Minor injury to Ruth - symbolic more than tactical
- No alarm raised - but it was close

---

## Tension
Peaks then settles - the "tight" success lands

---

## What Could Happen Next
1. Between chapter with Ahdia (Chapter 27)
2. Reaching Mother FAERIS - H5 (Chapter 28)
3. Korede's storyline intercutting

---

## Notes

**The violence:** Not action-movie. Clinical. Ruth is a medic - she knows anatomy. Tess is stealth - she knows how to end things quietly. This is what they're trained for.

**Ryu's shift:** He knew Ruth as team leader, medic, warm presence. Now he's seen her drop a man in three seconds. The competence is the same - just applied differently.

**Diana's silence:** She could have ended this without anyone getting hurt. A blink of temporal power. She watched instead. The cost of staying dark.

**Jericho's tell:** "Nice work." Steps over bodies without looking. Doesn't help, doesn't flinch, doesn't react. On first read: professional. On reread: he's been around violence he didn't care about before. This is nothing to him.

**Ruth's hand:** The injury is minor but it's the first blood. The heist has teeth now.

**Status:** Beat sheet complete. Ready for prose or TTRPG rolling.
