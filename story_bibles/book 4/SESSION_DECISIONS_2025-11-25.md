# Session Decisions - November 25, 2025

## Major Structural Decisions

### Genre Framework Locked
- **Ruth's Quest = Ocean's 11 (Heist)** - Stealth, deception, infiltration
- **Korede's Front = Dirty Dozen (War)** - Attrition, holding the line, sabotage
- **Convergence at Chapter 31** - Both storylines collide at Mother FAERIS excavation point

### Diana's Powers Limited
- Bellatrix is a more powerful Temporalist
- Any temporal manipulation near CADENS = detection beacon
- Diana must stay "dark" during infiltration
- Saving herself for transcendence moment (Ch 34-35)

### The Score (Ruth's Heist)
1. Send message to Ahdia (picoframe solution) - Ch 20
2. Infiltrate CADENS (enemy territory under Bellatrix)
3. Reach Mother FAERIS (underground)
4. Execute wake protocol (Ryu has it from Bourn, Book 3)
5. Open rift
6. Rescue Ahdia

### Wake Protocol Canon
- Bourn gave wake protocol to Ryu in Book 3
- "She deserves to choose" - Mother FAERIS's freedom
- Ryu carries it; it's the key to everything
- Need physical access to Mother FAERIS to use it

## Signal Communication Mechanic

### Ahdia's Powers DO Work in The Between
- She tries them, thinks they fail
- They bleed OUTWARD across dimensional barriers
- Every "failed" attempt = fold echoes / temporal wake
- That's the signal Earth detects
- She's been calling for help without knowing it

### Terminology (No Standard Term - Unprecedented)
- Ryu: "Fold echoes"
- Diana: "Temporal wake"
- Jericho: "Substrate harmonics"

### Picoframe Solution
- Can't receive from Ahdia, but CAN send
- Compress video messages using picoframe tech
- Pepper the temporal wake with data
- Looks like static/interference unless decoded
- Message: "Return to where you entered. We're reopening the rift. Window is short. Be there."

## Chapter Status

### Completed Beats (TTRPG Rolled)
- **Chapter 15:** Signal detected, coalition splits
- **Chapter 16:** Ahdia arrives in The Between
- **Chapter 17:** Finding Bourn (active hunt), Jericho revealed as asset, Korede first wave, Eidolon embodied
- **Chapter 18:** Ahdia food/exploration, mass grave discovery
- **Chapter 19:** Korede second wave, Eidolon attack, Leah's stand
- **Chapter 20:** Ruth analyzes signal, picoframe solution, sends message
- **Chapter 21:** Ahdia breakdown, AR-Ryu's feelings slip through, bond deepens

### Chapter Distribution
- **15:** Earth (Ruth - signal detected, coalition splits)
- **16:** Between (Ahdia arrival)
- **17:** Earth (Finding Bourn, Jericho asset, Korede first wave)
- **18:** Between (Ahdia - food, mass grave)
- **19:** Earth (Korede - second wave, Eidolon attack, Leah's stand)
- **20:** Earth (Ruth - picoframe solution sent)
- **21:** Between (Ahdia - breakdown, AR-Ryu bond)
- **22-30:** TBD
- **31:** Convergence
- **32-35:** Aftermath, Diana transcendence

## Key Character Updates

### AR-Ryu
- Is Ryu's BRAIN COPY, not programmed AI
- Has always been Ryu underneath clinical mode
- Has crush on Ahdia (always has)
- Chapter 21: Feelings slip through when she breaks down
- His death will be devastating because of this bond

### Ryu (Real)
- Has wake protocol from Bourn (Book 3)
- Mentored by Jericho Books 2-3 (6-8 months)
- Buried suspicion about Jericho he won't voice
- Book 5 betrayal will devastate him

### Jericho
- Bourn's "asset" inside CADENS
- Actually the mastermind manipulating everyone
- His expertise in "substrate harmonics" makes him central to signal interpretation
- Playing all sides toward his escape with Mother FAERIS

### Bourn
- Fugitive since Book 3
- Hard to find - good at hiding
- Someone else is hunting her too
- Gave Ryu wake protocol ("She deserves to choose")
- Has Jericho as inside man (doesn't know he's the real threat)

## Next Session Starting Points

### Immediate
- Chapter 22: Need to define (likely Earth - Ruth planning heist?)
- Suzie meeting: Needs to happen AFTER more Ahdia isolation (not Ch 21)
- Message decoded: After Suzie meeting, when Ahdia has access to Pio's comm

### Open Questions
- When does Suzie appear? (Ahdia needs more desperation first)
- Chapter 22-30 structure for heist progression
- Korede's sabotage mission development
- When/how do the timelines nearly intersect before convergence?

## Quick Reference

### The Heist Crew (Ruth's Quest)
- Ruth (leader)
- Diana (brains, can't use powers)
- Ryu (tech, wake protocol)
- Tess (FAERIS connection, lost drone)
- Jericho (inside man / traitor)
- Bourn (intel, off-site)

### The Squad (Korede's Front)
- Korede (leader, rage issues)
- Ben (tactics, "dies" holding line)
