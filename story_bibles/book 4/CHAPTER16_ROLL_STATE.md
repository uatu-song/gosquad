## Final Chapter 16 State

### Physical Condition
- **Injuries:** None (perfect landing)
- **Status:** Severely exhausted from insomnia
- **Penalties:** -2 to all rolls in Chapter 17/18

### Resources
- **Battery:** 95.5%
  - Started: 100%
  - Fall/EVA/Unconscious: -2% → 98%
  - Lost/Extra Scanning: -2% → 96%
  - Water System (Day 1): -0.5% → 95.5%
- **Water:** 1.5L/day production (excellent)
- **Air:** Breathable environment (marginal quality, needs repairs)
- **Food:** None (unsolved, critical next chapter)

### Daily Resource Drain
- **Battery:** 0.5%/day (water system only)
- **Projected Battery Life:** 190 days at current drain rate
- **Water Production:** 1.5L/day (sustainable)

### Mental/Emotional State
- **Morale:** Functional but fragile
- **Status:** Cosmic displacement terror, determined survival instinct
- **Sleep:** Insomnia (adrenaline crash + alien environment + near-death crisis)
- **Trauma:** Near-death air crisis (found panic room with 2h air remaining)

### Location/Shelter
- **Base:** Ancient panic room in ruins
- **Condition:** Marginal (breathable air, needs repairs)
- **Security:** Unknown (hasn't explored threats yet)

### Equipment Status
- **AR-Ryu:** Fully functional (hologram + audio)
- **Visor Sensors:** Glitchy for distance readings (dimensional interference)
- **Battlesuit:** Intact, EVA mode functional
- **Water System:** Operational, better than expected efficiency

### Knowledge Gained
- Powers don't work in The Between (tested, confirmed)
- Team cannot be contacted (comms dead)
- Rift sealed (no visible return path)
- Ruins are ancient, non-human architecture
- Panic room suggests someone survived here before
- Dimensional physics interfere with sensor readings

### Unknown/Unresolved
- Food sources
- Who built ruins/panic room
- How Bellatrix survived here
- If team is searching
- Return path to Earth
- Other threats in dimension

---

## Narrative Consequences

### Immediate (Chapter 17/18)
- Exhaustion penalty (-2 to all rolls)
- Must find food source urgently
- Water secured (not a crisis)
- Battery life comfortable (190 days)

### Medium-Term
- Panic room repairs needed
- Further exploration required
- Threat assessment pending
- Loneliness/isolation building

### Long-Term Setup
- AR-Ryu relationship foundation (tool → companion arc begins)
- Survival skills proving essential (no powers = human capability matters)
- Battery countdown established (ticking clock for AR-Ryu's existence)

---

## Roll Analysis

### Critical Success: Water System (Roll 8: 21)
- **Impact:** Major hope spot in desperate chapter
- **Consequence:** Better efficiency means longer survival runway
- **Emotional:** Small victory amid cosmic horror

### Critical Failure: First Night Rest (Roll 9: 4)
- **Impact:** Exhaustion carries into next chapter (-2 penalty)
- **Consequence:** Makes Chapter 17/18 more dangerous
- **Emotional:** Cost of trauma visible, not easily recovered

### Key Failure: Navigation (Roll 6: 9)
- **Impact:** Near-death air crisis (2h remaining)
- **Consequence:** Establishes stakes, shows vulnerability
- **Emotional:** Visceral terror, luck element visible

### Notable: Perfect Landing (Roll 1: 22)
- **Impact:** Victor's training payoff, no injury penalties
- **Consequence:** Allows functionality despite other crises
- **Emotional:** Gratitude callback, team's impact visible

## GM Notes

**Chaos vs Control Balance:**
- Touchpoints achieved (stranded → panic room established)
- Journey highly variable (near-death vs water success)
- State realistic (exhaustion + hope mixed)

**Propagating Consequences:**
- Insomnia penalty must appear in Chapter 17/18 rolls
- Water success reduces one pressure point
- Food becomes critical focus
- Exhaustion affects everything

**Emotional Beats Achieved:**
- Terror (fall, lost, air crisis)
- Hope (perfect landing, water success)
- Crushing disappointment (AR-Ryu not Ryu)
- Determination (keeps moving despite fear)
- Cost (insomnia, exhaustion)

---

**Status:** Chapter 16 roll state locked, ready for method actor performance
**Next Chapter Modifiers:** -2 to all rolls (exhaustion from insomnia)
