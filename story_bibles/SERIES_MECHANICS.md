## AR-Ryu System

### What It Is
AR-Ryu is a cybernetic brain mapping of Dr. Shiba Ryu that runs on Ahdia's HUD processors. It's not just a voice assistant—it's a full holographic presence that appears to be physically standing next to her.

### How It Works

**Activation:**
1. Ahdia freezes time
2. AR-Ryu activates in her HUD (translucent, usually in peripheral vision)
3. He can walk, gesture, react—appears fully present
4. Operates at picosecond framerate (can function in frozen time)

**The Upload:**
1. AR-Ryu has all of Real-Ryu's memories up to the moment time froze
2. During the freeze, AR-Ryu and Ahdia can have full conversations, strategize, connect
3. When Ahdia unfreezes time, everything that happened uploads to Real-Ryu's brain
4. Real-Ryu remembers it like it happened to him—not watched, EXPERIENCED

**What Ryu Experiences:**
- He doesn't watch footage—he receives memories
- If AR-Ryu walked beside Ahdia for 47 minutes watching her burn herself down, Real-Ryu remembers walking beside her for 47 minutes, helpless to stop her
- If AR-Ryu said "Ahdia, you need to stop" and she waved her hand through his chest, Real-Ryu remembers saying it and being dismissed
- The emotional weight transfers. The helplessness transfers.

**Key Distinction:**
- AR-Ryu is not a recording—he's a functional consciousness copy
- He develops independently during extended separations
- He can have opinions, make decisions, feel things
- Real-Ryu and AR-Ryu are the same person—until they're not

### Limitations
- AR-Ryu only exists in Ahdia's HUD (can't be projected elsewhere)
- Requires time freeze to activate (can't function in normal time)
- Upload requires HUD integrity—if HUD is damaged, memories may be lost or corrupted
- AR-Ryu can't physically affect anything (holographic only)

### Tragic Setup (Future Books)
- During extended mission, AR-Ryu and Ahdia develop romantic relationship in frozen time
- HUD destroyed before upload completes
- Real-Ryu knows intellectually that "he" loved her but doesn't have the emotional memories
- Ahdia experienced real love that now only exists in her memory

## Temporal Powers (Hyper Seed)

### Core Mechanic: Selective Time Bubbles
Ahdia doesn't "freeze time globally." She creates localized fields where time moves at different rates.

### Primary Ability: Time Freeze

**What She Can Do:**
- Freeze time in localized area (room to city block)
- Move freely through frozen space
- Interact with frozen objects/people (massless to her)
- Duration: Trained up to 47+ minutes (Book 2 opening)

**Visual/Sensory:**
- World goes purple-tinted and silent
- Frozen objects are massless, can be repositioned
- Cold pressure in chest (Seed location)
- HUD continues functioning

**Limitations:**
- Cannot freeze own biology (heart keeps beating)
- Cannot freeze cosmic entities or other Temporalists
- Draining—longer freezes cost more cellular integrity

### Cost Structure: Cellular Degradation

**How It Works:**
- Each power use causes accelerated cellular breakdown
- Measured as percentage of "baseline" remaining
- Not recoverable naturally—only slowed by treatment
- At 0% = death (or transcendence—see hidden truth)

**Book 2 Baseline Progression:**
- Start of Book 2: ~90%
- After Chapter 1 riot (47-minute freeze): ~67-71%
- After Chapter 4 Eastern Europe op: ~52%
- End of Chapter 24: ~0.7% (near death)

**Physical Symptoms:**
- Nosebleeds (common, escalating)
- Vision blurring
- Bleeding from ears, eyes (extreme use)
- Muscle weakness, tremors
- Loss of consciousness

### Secondary Abilities

**Force Amplification:**
- Actions in frozen time are amplified when time resumes
- Gentle tap → baseball bat impact
- Moving person → appears as teleportation
- Must be physically possible action

**Go Squad "Enhancement":**
- Ahdia creates temporal bubbles around team members
- FAERIS executes the effect within that bubble
- Team experiences: enhanced jumps, amplified strikes, apparent superpowers
- They don't know she's helping (until Book 1 reveal)

### Activation Gestures (Team)

| Member | Gesture | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Tess (Gloom Girl) | Middle finger + eye-tracking | Translocation |
| Ben (Night Knight) | Crouch + jump | Trajectory amplification |
| Leah (Battlea) | Battle cry + forward momentum | Velocity multiplication |
| Victor (Crimson Sable) | Grabbing gesture + grasping motion | Force amplification |

## FAERIS Drones

### What They Are
**FAERIS** = Field-Adaptive Entanglement Reconnaissance and Infiltration System

Advanced surveillance and translocation technology managed by CADENS, operated primarily by Dr. Ryu.

### Core Capabilities

**1. Picosecond Frame Recording**
- Captures events at trillionth-of-a-second intervals
- Can record frozen time events from outside the bubble
- Powered by cataclysm ore (finite resource)

**2. Translocation**
- Quantum entanglement teleportation
- Drone "paints" target with beam
- Space folds—subject didn't move to destination, destination moved to subject
- Same particles, not copies (no existential copy question)
- Experience: Extreme disorientation, nausea, sense of wrongness

**3. Surveillance**
- Stealth monitoring
- Multi-spectrum observation
- Can be detected by observant individuals

### How They Work with Ahdia's Powers
- FAERIS executes effects within Ahdia's temporal bubbles
- Ahdia creates the field, FAERIS amplifies/translocates within it
- Team powers = Ahdia's temporal manipulation + FAERIS amplification

### Limitations
- Cannot operate inside time bubbles (only observe from edge)
- Cataclysm ore is finite—can't spam translocation
- Ahdia can detect them in frozen time

## Cellular Regeneration Treatment

### What It Is
Experimental therapy developed by Ruth Carter, adapted for temporal degradation by Ruth + Ryu using CADENS resources.

### The Autoinjector
- Delivery mechanism for CR-7 Temporal Variant treatment
- Click, hiss, injection
- Ahdia's association: Firas injected her with the final treatment before being pulled into the singularity

### How Treatment Works
- Accelerates cellular repair in response to temporal stress damage
- NOT a cure—extends timeline from weeks to 18-24 months
- Requires ongoing treatments (initially every 3 days, then weekly)
- Can only be administered with CADENS equipment

### Hidden Truth (Unknown to Characters)
- Cellular breakdown isn't death—it's TRANSCENDENCE
- Ahdia's human body failing = Conclave consciousness shedding physical form
- Treatment PREVENTS transcendence by stabilizing human cellular structure
- Ruth thinks she's saving Ahdia's life—actually keeping her trapped in human form
- Neither Ruth nor Ahdia know this yet

### Book 1 Context
- Eight autoinjectors grabbed by Ahdia in final battle
- She time-accelerated herself to integrate treatments faster
- Firas took the final injector and used it on HER instead of himself
- That injection saved her life, cost him his
- The autoinjector is now associated with Firas's sacrifice

## CADENS Organization

### What It Is
Shadow government agency protecting humanity from cosmic threats. Modern version of historical "Vigilis Exceptus" (cosmic guardians).

### Key Personnel (Book 2)

**Director Harriet Bourn:**
- Chief Overseer
- Career bureaucrat, believed in mission
- Eventually defects (Book 2) after learning TRIOMF infiltrated CADENS

**Dr. Shiba Ryu:**
- FAERIS Operations Specialist
- Ahdia's handler
- In love with Ahdia (unspoken)
- Operates AR-Ryu system

### Relationship to Ahdia
- Recruited her after warehouse incident (Book 1)
- She declined official membership
- Operates as unofficial asset with stolen equipment
- They need her; she needs their treatment

---

## The Hyper Seed

### What It Is
Fourth-dimensional artifact created by The Conclave. Bonded with Ahdia permanently—cannot be removed.

### Physical Integration
- Sits in chest near heart
- Described as "cold" and "heavy"
- Pulses when power is used
- Visible as blue light through skin when active

### True Purpose (Unknown in Books 1-2)
- Beacon for planetary harvesting
- Marks worlds for consumption by Helminth tardigrade
- 847 worlds previously seeded and consumed
- Earth is world #848
- Power use increases "visibility" to the tardigrade

---

## Firas Bacchus

### Status
**DISPLACED, NOT DEAD.** Will return Book 7.

### What Happened (Book 1 Finale)
- Helped Ahdia channel opposing temporal forces to collapse Kain's singularity
- Took the final autoinjector from her hand
- Injected it into HER to save her life
- Was pulled into the singularity while team formed human chain to save Ahdia
- Last words (lip-read over singularity roar): "Oh hey. I knew you were in there somewhere."

### The Autoinjector Moment
- Ahdia was dissolving into higher-dimensional space
- She was trying to inject Firas to save him
- He reversed it—injected her instead
- The click-hiss of the autoinjector is the last physical sensation before he was gone
- That sound is now a trauma trigger for Ahdia

## Writing Notes

### When Describing AR-Ryu:
- He appears physically present, not just a voice
- Translucent but solid-looking
- Can walk beside her, gesture, react
- She can wave her hand through him
- His expression is "calibrated"—designed to seem concerned
- He's not really there. He's never really there.

### When Describing Time Freeze:
- World goes purple-tinted and silent
- Sound cuts off "like someone hit mute"
- Frozen objects are suspended, massless
- She can taste/smell things (tear gas burns even frozen)
- Her own blood falls in real-time (only moving thing besides her)

### When Describing Cellular Cost:
- Cold in chest that spreads (spine, skull, eyes)
- Physical tremors, weakness
- Nosebleed escalating to ears, eyes
- Vision blurring at edges
- HUD warnings: "CELLULAR INTEGRITY: XX%"

### When Describing Treatment:
- Autoinjector: click, hiss
- Association with Firas's death
- The sound alone can trigger flashback
