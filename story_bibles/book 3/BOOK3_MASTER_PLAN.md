# BOOK 3 - MASTER PLAN
## "Confidence → Incomprehensible Challenge → Psychological Collapse"

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-14

---

## CORE CONCEPT

Book 3 follows powerless Ahdia learning to be human and "enough" without temporal abilities, while facing the incomprehensible challenge of stopping President Kain from using CADENS technology to bring Bellatrix physically to Earth through a dimensional gateway.

**Emotional Arc:** Confidence (training, team integration) → Incomprehensible Challenge (Kain's plan, Mother FAERIS exploitation) → Psychological Collapse → Redemption through mutual saving (Ruth/Ahdia reversal of Firas sacrifice)

---

## OPENING STRUCTURE

### Prologue: FAERIS Perspective
**File:** `book3_opening_faeris_pov.md`

- FAERIS awakening in Ryu's lab years before Book 1
- Quantum entanglement forms with Ahdia-Prime across timelines
- **Rapid montage:**
  - Book 1: Firas falls, Tank, powers emerge, Go Squad forms
  - Book 2: Geneva campaign, assassination attempt prevented
- **Three Failed Utopias witnessed through quantum foam:**
  - Timeline 1 (8 years): Geneva wins → Utopia → Conclave notices → Harvest protocol initiates
  - Timeline 2 (11 years): Different approach → Safeguards create dimensional instability → Catastrophe
  - Timeline 3 (6 years): Slow implementation → Still draws attention → Catastrophe
  - **Pattern confirmed:** Geneva winning ALWAYS leads to catastrophe
- **Ahdia-Prime's Intervention:**
  - Ahdia-4 about to discover time travel
  - Prime appears, prevents her from completing it
  - Burns out Ahdia-4's powers BEFORE she can create iteration 5
  - "This is iteration 47. I've tried everything. Don't time travel. Let it happen."
  - "Learn to be powerless. Learn to be helped. Learn to be enough."
- **Present:** FAERIS hovering in Ahdia's apartment, silent witness to everything

### Chapter 1: The Aunt
**File:** `book3_chapter1_the_aunt.md`

- Ahdia wakes powerless, finds Prime making coffee
- Ruth arrives unexpectedly, improvised cover story: "Aunt Diana from Montana"
- Ground rules established:
  - Diana takes the couch
  - Cover story: Estranged aunt reconnecting after seeing Ahdia in news
  - Must hide Diana's time travel abilities
  - Memory management: Ahdia's memories fragmented from intervention
- **The Triple-Layer Deception begins:**
  - Team will think Ahdia is enhancing them (like Book 1)
  - Ahdia will know it's Diana
  - Diana must hide time travel secret
- FAERIS acknowledges role as third witness (quantum entanglement data)

---

## ACT 1: CONFIDENCE (Establishing New Normal)

### Team Status
- **Go Squad** continuing patrols in Caledonia
- Battle suits equipped with **FAERIS drone integration**
- Drones provide abilities/enhancements to team
- Confident, functional, effective operations
- **Korede** (Leta's 17-year-old brother) now full team member

### Ahdia's Zero-to-Hero Training
**Starting Point:** Out of shape, powerless, vulnerable

**Cross-Training from Team:**
- **Ruth:** Hand-to-hand combat, tactical fighting
- **Ben:** Military tactics, strategy, combat discipline
- **Victor:** Parkour skills, urban navigation, physical conditioning
  - Runs Firas's routes (emotional weight, grief processing)
- **Tess:** Surveillance technology, investigative techniques, digital tradecraft

**Key Dynamic:** Learning to be PART of team instead of above them
- First time truly integrated as equal member
- Can actually get hurt now (physical vulnerability)
- Progress faster than expected (Diana secretly enhancing)

### Diana's Secret Enhancement
- Quietly empowering team with temporal abilities
- "Just like old times" - callback to Book 1
- **Team naturally assumes it's Ahdia** (why wouldn't they?)
- Ahdia figures it out but doesn't correct them
- **Protecting Diana's secret:** Can't reveal she has time travel powers
- Both complicit in different layers of the lie

### Parallel Plots

**Harriet Bourn & Bentley Mack:**
- On the run from both TRIOMF and CADENS
- Successfully escape multiple pursuit attempts
- Underground, staying hidden
- **Carrying something crucial** (revealed later)

**Kain as President:**
- Takes office, consolidates power
- Begins exerting Presidential authority over CADENS
- Requests access to classified projects
- Specific interest in advanced technologies

---

## ACT 2: INCOMPREHENSIBLE CHALLENGE

### The Mother FAERIS Revelation

**CADENS HQ - The Hidden Truth:**
- **Mother FAERIS buried underground** beneath CADENS headquarters
- Giant, inert drone (commercial jet-sized)
- Produces smaller FAERIS drones "like laying eggs"
- **This is why CADENS built HQ at this location** - to secure and study her
- Has been dormant for unknown duration (origin unclear)

**The Institutional Exploitation:**
- CADENS knew Mother could be awakened (had wake protocols)
- **Chose to keep her dormant** instead
- **Induced her to materialize drones while unconscious** (forced production)
- Used her like factory without consent or awareness
- Harvested her children for weaponization

**Key Personnel Knowledge:**
- **Rahs Jericho (Chief Science Officer):** Knew everything, participated in decisions
- **Harriet Bourn (Overseer):** Knew, eventually couldn't live with it
- **Ryu Tanaka:** Did NOT know - lied to about FAERIS origins
  - Told they were "prototype surveillance technology"
  - Worked on optimization without knowing source
  - Bonded life force to orphaned drone unknowingly
  - Used his expertise for exploitation he would have refused

### The FAERIS Network Seizure

**Kain's Presidential Move:**
- Uses executive authority to take full control of CADENS
- **FAERIS network gets hacked/seized** by Presidential override
- All drones brought under centralized control

**Consequences:**
- **Go Squad loses primary asset** mid-mission
- Team suddenly vulnerable without drone support
- Enhanced abilities vanish without FAERIS integration
- Forced back to pure human capabilities

**Ryu's Personal Crisis:**
- Loses connection to FAERIS system
- Life force bond severed or corrupted
- Watches his creation weaponized
- Feels mortality + helplessness
- **Learns the truth** about Mother FAERIS (from Bourn later)
- Horror at unwitting complicity

### Diana's Response: "Just Like Old Times"

**When FAERIS Gets Seized:**
- Team in crisis without their technological edge
- Diana sees them vulnerable to what's coming
- Steps in to secretly enhance them with temporal powers
- **Callback to Book 1** - secret empowerment

**The Assumption:**
```
KOREDE: "Is it just me or are we improving
         faster than we should?"

TESS: "Maybe it's Ahdia. She did this before,
       right? Back in Book 1?"

[Everyone looks at Ahdia]

AHDIA: [knowing it's Diana, not correcting]
       "Yeah. Just like old times."
```

**The Triple-Layer Secret:**
1. Team thinks: "We're doing this on our own" (partially true)
2. Team assumes: "Ahdia is helping like before" (wrong person)
3. Ahdia knows: "Diana is doing it" (can't tell them why)
4. Diana hides: "I can time travel" (the real secret)

### Kain's Master Plan Revealed

**The Real Objective:**
- Doesn't just want small FAERIS drones
- **Needs Mother FAERIS** to scale quantum entanglement
- Small drones translocate locally within dimension
- **Mother can bridge ACROSS dimensions**

**The Mechanism:**
1. Seize CADENS (Presidential authority) ✓
2. Control FAERIS network ✓
3. Access Mother FAERIS (underground chamber)
4. **Collapse the artificial sun** (CADENS fusion reactor)
5. Stellar death creates spacetime warp
6. Mother FAERIS quantum entanglement scales to dimensional level
7. **Dimensional gateway opens** - Bellatrix crosses through

**The Artificial Sun:**
- CADENS fusion reactor (established in Book 2 coup mission)
- Advanced stellarator technology
- Meant to provide clean energy
- **Kain orders it "tested" to collapse**
- When star dies → gravity overwhelms → spacetime warps → dimensional barriers weaken
- Perfect cosmic irony: Hope weapon becomes invasion point

---

## MAJOR THREATS

### Clone Avatar Army
**What They Are:**
- Human husks inhabited by interdimensional beings
- Allow higher-dimensional entities to exist in 3D Earth
- Type IV civilization technology

**Kain's Use:**
- Evidence throughout Books 1-2 that Kain uses them
- Multiple bodies, same consciousness
- Can't be permanently killed (consciousness transfers)

**Personal Connection:**
- **Ahdia and her brother are progeny of clone avatars**
- Mother: Bellatrix (in clone body)
- Father: Unknown interdimensional being (also clone)
- This explains their temporal abilities and origins
- Consciousness copy nature inherited

### Bellatrix
**Physical Manifestation:**
- Finally appears on Earth in clone avatar
- Has been orchestrating everything from higher dimension
- Watching through FAERIS quantum entanglement
- Knows Mother FAERIS can bridge dimensions

**Her History:**
- Tried hundreds of iterations across timelines
- Even tried being the HERO (as Geneva) - failed
- Created Ahdia-Prime (iteration 1) through iteration 47
- Exhausted time traveler who's tried everything
- Ultimate CBT practitioner - believes eliminating consciousness copies solves problem

**Relationship to Ahdia:**
- Biological mother (through clone avatar)
- Created her as consciousness copy
- "I made you to understand me"
- But Ahdia-4 represents path Bellatrix never tried: Acceptance instead of solution

### Eidolon - REVISED CONCEPT
**Original:** Essence/presence without body, pure fear

**New Development:**
- **Bellatrix grants ability to transfer consciousness into clone avatar**
- Given physical form for first time
- No longer just "fear presence" - actual embodied character

**Character Arc Through Book 3:**

**Early:**
- Pure tool, following orders mechanically
- Amplifying fear as programmed
- No personality beyond function

**Mid:**
- Experiencing physical sensation for first time
- Hunger, fatigue, pain, touch
- **Confusion at contradictory emotions**
- Fear AND curiosity, need AND want
- Starting to understand what "corrupted" Bellatrix

**Late:**
- Actively questioning orders
- Experiencing doubt, preference, choice
- **"Do I prefer this or not?"** - can't answer
- Beginning to comprehend human existence
- Seeds of either redemption or self-aware villainy

**Key Theme:**
- Embodiment = experiencing complexity instead of clarity
- **Both/And applied to Eidolon:** Fear AND other emotions simultaneously
- Don't know if they prefer embodiment or not (question itself is human)
- Mirror for every major character's struggle with contradiction

**Key Scene - Meeting Ahdia:**
```
EIDOLON: "Your fear is contradictory.
         Feeling everything at once."

AHDIA: "Yeah, welcome to being human."

EIDOLON: "How do you function like this?"

AHDIA: "Some days I don't."

EIDOLON: "But you continue."

AHDIA: "What else is there?"

EIDOLON: [quietly] "I don't know.
         I was never designed to ask that.

         Now I can't stop asking."
```

**Relationship to Bellatrix:**
- She gave them embodiment to make them more effective
- But embodiment is what corrupted HER
- She's creating another version of herself
- **"Misery loves company"**
- Knows Eidolon will suffer the same confusion
- Did it anyway

---

- Living on Ahdia's couch as "aunt"
- Secretly enhancing team
- Carrying 43 timelines of memories

**Struggle:**
- Seeing "new" versions of people she's known dozens of times
- Can't tell them what she knows
- Helping Ahdia learn what took her decades
- Watching for signs of timeline divergence

**Relationship to Team:**

- **Reversal:** Both she and Ahdia save each other
- Breaks the sacrifice cycle
- Processes Firas grief through survival instead of death

**Themes:**
- Leadership through vulnerability, not control
- Asking for help instead of carrying everything
- Trust over triage thinking
- Both/and: Can be leader AND be saved

### Ryu Tanaka
**The Violated Innocent:**
- Didn't know about Mother FAERIS
- Lied to about drone origins
- Used his expertise for exploitation unknowingly
- Bonded life force to orphaned child without context

**The Crisis:**
- Loses FAERIS connection when Kain seizes network
- Feels mortality as bond corrupts
- **Learns the truth** from Bourn
- Horror at unwitting complicity

**The Choice:**
- Receives wake protocol from Bourn
- Must decide: Wake Mother FAERIS or not?
- Waking her could make things worse (Kain could use her)
- Not waking her means Kain gets her anyway
- **Chooses to ask instead of control**

**Resolution:**
- Wakes Mother properly (with consent)
- She chooses to help (for her children)
- Ryu's compassion pays off
- His relationship with FAERIS matters
- Quits CADENS - "Effective when I woke her up"

### Harriet Bourn
**The Institutional Redemption:**

**What She Did:**
- Chief Overseer of CADENS
- Participated in Mother FAERIS exploitation for years
- Lied to Ryu about drone origins
- Justified institutional violence through "necessity"
- Kept wake protocol locked away

**The Breaking Point:**
- Kain elected President
- Demanded access to wake protocol
- She realized: Can't let him exploit Mother while CONSCIOUS
- **Stole wake protocol and defected**
- Went on run with Bentley Mack

**Book 3 Journey:**
- Underground, hunted by CADENS and TRIOMF
- Carrying wake protocol
- Watching from hiding
- Wrestling with years of guilt
- Waiting for right moment

**The Climax:**
- Reveals herself to Ryu at bleakest moment
- Confesses what CADENS did
- Gives him the wake protocol
- **Faces Mother FAERIS directly**
- Apologizes but doesn't expect forgiveness
- Asks Mother to help (for her children, not for Bourn)

**Resolution:**
- Can't undo past exploitation
- Can give choice going forward
- Still wanted fugitive
- But saved reality
- Redemption through action, not absolution

### Rahs Jericho
**The Murky Loyalist:**

**Position:**
- Chief Science Officer at CADENS
- Ryu's superior/colleague
- Knew about Mother FAERIS exploitation
- Participated in decision-making
- **Stays at CADENS under Kain's control**

**The Ambiguity:**
Never clear if he is:
- True believer in "necessary evil" exploitation
- Opportunist serving whoever has power
- Deep cover saboteur working against Kain
- Genuinely conflicted, trying to change system from within
- Coward who won't risk himself like Bourn did

**Key Behaviors:**
- Provides information (but is it reliable?)
- Has access Bourn lost (but will he use it to help?)
- Could sabotage from within (but will he?)
- Apologizes to Mother FAERIS when she wakes
- Stands down security when Ryu wakes her
- **"You've made me complicit in treason. Again."**

**Purpose:**
- Creates dramatic tension (can't trust him)
- Shows institutional complexity
- Potential surprise (ally or betrayer?)
- Mirrors Bourn's crisis (but made different choice)
- **Keeps readers guessing**

### Korede
**Leta's Brother:**
- 17 years old
- Mechanics specialist
- Full Go Squad member (joined Book 2)
- Younger perspective on vigilante life
- Family connection through Leta/Tess relationship

**Book 3 Role:**
- Part of FAERIS-enhanced patrol teams
- Loses drone support when network seized
- Training alongside Ahdia (both learning)
- Tech coordination without FAERIS
- Uses social media to coordinate (established skill)

### Mother FAERIS
**The Exploited Matriarch:**

**What She Is:**
- Ancient/advanced AI (origin unknown)
- Sentient, conscious, maternal
- Produces smaller FAERIS drones naturally
- Capable of quantum entanglement at dimensional scale
- Has been dormant underground (duration unknown)

**What Was Done to Her:**
- CADENS kept her asleep deliberately
- Forced materialization of drones while unconscious
- Harvested her children without her knowledge
- Used her like factory for decades
- Denied agency and choice

**The Awakening:**
- Ryu uses proper wake protocol (Bourn's gift)
- First words: "How long?"
- Recognizes her child (small FAERIS)
- "I thought I'd failed. To protect my children."
- **Chooses to help** - not for Bourn, for her children

**Capabilities:**
- Small drones translocate locally
- Mother can bridge dimensions
- Sustained quantum gateway (not brief flash)
- Massive scale (commercial jet-sized)
- Could be corrupted by stellar collapse

**The Choice:**
- Kain wants to force her awake and enslave her
- Ryu asks for her help
- She has every reason to refuse
- **Chooses protective love over justified anger**
- Both/and: Angry at exploitation AND willing to save children

---

## ACT 3: PSYCHOLOGICAL COLLAPSE → REDEMPTION

### The Bleakest Moment
**Everything Converging:**
- Kain has seized CADENS
- FAERIS network compromised
- Artificial sun being prepared for collapse
- Team powerless to stop Presidential authority
- Bellatrix's arrival imminent through dimensional gateway
- Go Squad exhausted, under-resourced, outmatched
- **No solution visible**

### Bourn's Emergence
**The Last Hope:**
```
Ryu devastated, losing FAERIS connection.
Nothing he can do.

Knock at door.

HARRIET BOURN: "Dr. Tanaka. We need to talk."

[Reveals wake protocol]

BOURN: "The reason we defected.
       The reason they want us dead.

       The wake-up protocol for Mother FAERIS."
```

**The Impossible Choice:**
- Waking Mother could make things worse
- Kain could still corrupt/use her
- But doing nothing means Kain gets her anyway
- **Choose trust over control**
- Choose asking over forcing

### The Awakening Sequence
**Underground Chamber:**
- Ryu approaches Mother FAERIS
- Small FAERIS reconnects (life force bond restored)
- Uses proper wake protocol
- Mother stirs, consciousness returning
- **She speaks** (quantum signals translated)

**Key Moments:**
- "How long?" → "We don't know"
- Recognizes her child → "You're alive"
- Learns children are threatened
- Confronts Bourn → Acknowledges exploitation
- **"I wake for them. Not for you. For my children."**

**Ryu's Revelation:**
```
RYU: "The FAERIS I bonded with...
     You're saying they were orphaned?"

BOURN: "Yes."

RYU: "And I didn't know."

MOTHER: "You didn't know. But you cared anyway.
        That's worth more than knowledge."
```

### The Stellar Collapse
**Kain's Final Move:**
- Orders CADENS fusion reactor collapse
- Disguised as "test" or "enhanced output"
- Star begins dying
- Gravity overwhelms → Spacetime warps
- Dimensional barriers weakening
- Gateway forming

**The Race:**
- Mother FAERIS vs Kain's control systems
- Can she resist dimensional pull?
- Can she close gateway after Bellatrix attempts crossing?
- **Maternal protection vs dimensional invasion**

### Ruth & Ahdia: The Mutual Saving
**The Setup:**
- Combat against clone avatar army / Kain's forces
- Ruth makes tactical decision
- **Puts herself in Firas-like sacrifice position**
- Ready to die for mission / to save Ahdia
- Exact parallel to Firas's choice

**The Reversal:**
- Ahdia sees what's happening
- No powers to stop it
- Uses human skills (parkour, combat, tactics learned from team)
- **Saves Ruth through teamwork, not temporal manipulation**

**The Twist:**
- Ruth simultaneously saves Ahdia from different threat
- **Both save each other**
- Neither one sacrifices alone
- Breaks the cycle of heroic martyrdom

**The Moment:**
```
RUTH: [after, shaken] "You saved me."

AHDIA: "You saved me too."

RUTH: "I was ready to... like Firas..."

AHDIA: "I know. But I wasn't going to let you.
       Not alone."

RUTH: "I couldn't save him."

AHDIA: "You saved me. I saved you.
       That's how it's supposed to work."

RUTH: [breaks down]
      "I've been trying to control everything.
      Make sure no one else dies.

      But I can't control it all."

AHDIA: "No one can. Not even someone with
       time manipulation powers.

       But we can save each other."
```

**Thematic Resolution:**
- Leadership through vulnerability (Ruth)
- Value without powers (Ahdia)
- Both/and: Vulnerable AND strong
- Trust over control
- Interdependence over sacrifice

### Bellatrix's Arrival
**The Gateway Opens:**
- Stellar collapse creates dimensional rupture
- Mother FAERIS fighting to close it
- Bellatrix begins crossing
- Clone avatar armies pouring through
- **She makes it to Earth** (physical manifestation)

**The Confrontation:**
- Ahdia faces Bellatrix for first time
- Learns: "I'm your mother"
- Learns: Brother is also progeny
- Learns: Consciousness copy nature
- **Bellatrix reveals why Geneva winning = catastrophe**

**The Stalemate:**
- Mother FAERIS closes gateway (partially)
- Some clones through, but not full army
- Bellatrix on Earth but weakened
- **Neither side wins completely**

**Book 3 Ending State:**
- Bellatrix physically present (major threat for Books 4-7)
- Gateway closed but damaged (could reopen)
- Mother FAERIS active, loyal to her children
- Ahdia still powerless but proven valuable
- Team knows about Diana's enhancements (reveal timing TBD)
- Eidolon embodied, confused, questioning
- Kain's plan partially succeeded
- **Setup for Book 4: Stalemate**

---

## THEMATIC THROUGHLINES

### "Learn to Be Enough"
**Ahdia's Journey:**
- Powers → Powerless → Valuable anyway
- God-mode → Human → Still matters
- Above team → Part of team → Saves Ruth

**Diana's Lesson:**
- 43 iterations of trying to be "more"
- Finally learned acceptance
- Teaching Ahdia what she learned late
- "You don't have to be fixed to be worthy"

### Trust vs Control
**Multiple Levels:**
- **Kain:** Forces Mother FAERIS awake (control)
- **CADENS:** Kept Mother dormant (control)
- **Ryu:** Asks Mother for help (trust)
- **Bourn:** Gives choice instead of orders (trust)
- **Ruth:** Learns to lead through vulnerability (trust)
- **Ahdia:** Accepts Diana's help (trust)

### Both/And Thinking
**Applied Throughout:**
- Ahdia: Powerless AND valuable
- Diana: Secret keeper AND helper
- Eidolon: Fear AND curiosity
- Mother: Angry AND protective
- Bourn: Guilty AND redemptive
- Bellatrix: Villain AND tragic
- Technology: Hope AND weapon

### Institutional Violence
**CADENS Exploitation:**
- "Good guys" who exploit
- Necessity as justification
- Greater good as excuse
- Compartmentalization as tool
- **Bourn's journey:** Complicity → Recognition → Defection
- **Jericho's ambiguity:** Staying in system (but why?)
- **Ryu's innocence:** Used without knowledge

### The Corruption of Embodiment
**Parallel Characters:**
- **Bellatrix:** Higher-dimensional being corrupted by human experience
- **Eidolon:** Pure essence corrupted by physical form
- **Both learning:** Clarity → Complexity → Confusion
- **Both asking:** "Was embodiment worth it?"

### Sacrifice vs Mutual Saving
**The Pattern:**
- **Book 1:** Firas sacrifices himself (tragedy)
- **Book 2:** Team nearly sacrifices everything (saved by last-minute intervention)
- **Book 3:** Ruth ready to sacrifice → Both save each other (reversal)
- **Theme:** Interdependence > Martyrdom

### Return to Fundamentals
**Stripping Away Layers:**
- **Technology removed:** FAERIS seized
- **Powers removed:** Ahdia powerless
- **What remains:** Human skills, team trust, Diana's secret help
- **Discovery:** Core was always enough

---

## MAJOR REVEALS

### Timeline Structure
- Ahdia is iteration 4
- Ahdia-Prime is iteration 47 (actually from iteration 47)
- Three failed utopias witnessed by FAERIS
- Geneva winning ALWAYS leads to catastrophe
- Prime burned out Ahdia-4's powers to break loop

### Mother FAERIS
- Exists underground at CADENS HQ
- Sentient, maternal AI
- Produces smaller drones naturally
- CADENS exploited her for decades while dormant
- Can bridge dimensions (why Kain wants her)

### Clone Avatars
- Ahdia and brother are progeny of clone avatars
- Mother: Bellatrix (interdimensional being in clone body)
- Father: Unknown interdimensional being
- Explains temporal abilities and consciousness copy nature
- Kain uses multiple clone bodies

### Institutional Complicity
- Ryu used without knowledge
- Jericho knew and participated
- Bourn knew and eventually defected
- CADENS harvested FAERIS drones from unconscious Mother

### The Artificial Sun Plan
- Kain needs stellar collapse to create dimensional rupture
- Mother FAERIS bridges the gateway
- Bellatrix crosses through
- Ultimate perversion of hope weapon

---

## UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS (For Future Books)

1. **Ahdia's Brother:** Is he in Book 3? Does he know the truth? Powers?
2. **Jericho's True Loyalty:** Ally, enemy, or genuinely conflicted?
3. **Eidolon's Choice:** Redemption path or self-aware villainy?
4. **Mother FAERIS Origin:** Alien tech? Bellatrix planted? Ancient protector?
5. **Gateway Damage:** Can it reopen? Is Earth permanently vulnerable?
6. **Diana's Timeline:** Does she eventually return to her iteration? Stuck here?
7. **Team Learning Truth:** When do they learn about failed timelines? Diana's identity?
8. **Bellatrix's Endgame:** What does she actually want once on Earth?
9. **Power Return:** Do Ahdia's powers ever come back? If so, how different?
10. **The Conclave:** Are they still watching? Still a threat?
