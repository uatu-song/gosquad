## PATTERN TRACKING

### POV Alternation:

- Ch9: Bellatrix (fear army creation) ← Antagonist chapter
- Ch10: Heroes (Exile Island refuge)

- Ch12: Should alternate to antagonist or continue heroes?

### Timeline:
- **5 Total Iterations** (NOT 43/47)
  - Iteration 1: Geneva assassinated, no utopia
  - Iteration 2: Rational blueprint → authoritarianism
  - Iteration 3: Piecemeal engineering → Bellatrix reveals
  - Iteration 4: Human conditioning → dystopia
  - Iteration 5: Current timeline, no utopia attempt
- **Prime = Ahdia-1** (lived through all iterations)
- **Current = Ahdia-5**

2. **When does Mother FAERIS fully wake?**
3. **When does fear army deploy against heroes?**
4. **When does brother appear?**
5. **When does Geneva = Bellatrix reveal happen?**
6. **When does Ahdia = Bellatrix's daughter reveal happen?**
