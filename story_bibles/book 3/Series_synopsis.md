# Auerbach Series - Complete Synopsis

**Seven-Book Arc:** CBT approach failing (Books 1-3) → Turning point (Book 4) → DBT approach succeeding (Books 5-7)

**Thematic Core:** You don't have to be fixed to be worthy

---

## Book 1: Complete Prose (Status: COMPLETE)

**Emotional Arc:** Avoidance → Forced action

**Status:**
- **Manuscript COMPLETE:** 6,342 lines, 402KB prose
- **File:** `/home/josephsong15/Auerbach/Book_1/builds/go_squad_manuscript.txt`
- **Format:** 30 chapters + epilogue, full narrative prose

**Story:** Ahdia Bacchus, a depressed hermit with time-manipulation powers, is forced out of isolation when her city erupts in crisis. She discovers her powers come at a cost—every use burns her lifespan through cellular degradation. The book establishes her isolation, her reliance on TV as her primary frame of reference, and introduces the Go Squad team.

**Key Events:**
- Ahdia's introduction as isolated Temporalist
- Powers revealed: time freeze, translocation, cellular degradation cost
- CADENS (governmental enhanced agency) relationship established
- Treatment dependency begins (Ruth as medical provider)
- Team formation: Go Squad assembles
- Red dress heist (Kain abuse evidence obtained)
- Ahdia learns using powers = burning lifespan
- First major crisis forces her into action

**Ending State:**
- Ahdia forced out of avoidance
- Team formed but relationships shallow
- Treatment dependency established
- Kain introduced as mayoral threat
- Cellular baseline: ~100% → ~90%

**Notes:** This is the baseline. Book 1 establishes Ahdia's voice, her coping mechanisms (TV references, deadpan humor, isolation), and the cost-benefit tension of her powers.

## Book 2: TTRPG Campaign Complete (Prose Pending)

**Emotional Arc:** Sacrifice everything → Win through vulnerability

**Status:**
- 24-chapter beat-by-beat structure complete (TTRPG-generated, 5000+ beats)
- Comprehensive planning JSON: `/home/josephsong15/Auerbach/Book_2/tools/TTRPG_DATA_REFERENCE.json` (884 lines)
- Prose conversion: NOT YET STARTED

**Timeline:** 12 months, Month 1 = Isaiah riot through Month 12 = Election Night

### Month-by-Month Summary:

**Month 1: Crisis Cascade**
- Isaiah Bennett memorial riot → Ahdia freezes time 47 minutes (saves 23, loses 16, nearly dies)
- Governor Geneva Windrow assassinated at debate (professional sniper, translocation signature)
- Ahdia prevents stampede (3min freeze)
- Officer Marcus Webb exonerated for Isaiah killing (Grand jury no-bill)
- First Eidolon mob attack (flash lynch mob, Ahdia translocates to safety)
- **Backend:** Jakarta operation (11,000 saved, baseline drops 16-20% in single mission)
- Treatment dependency becomes critical
- Baseline: 100% → 90% → ~67-71%

**Month 2: Enablement Cycle Begins**
- Ryu crosses line: provides Eastern Europe coordinates (first intel handoff)
- Pattern established: Intel → Coordinates → Intervention → Emergency treatment → Falsified records → Repeat
- Kain announces fusion reactor (10-month timeline, scientists say 3-5 years minimum)
- Victor teaches Leah "But vs And" thinking (linguistic distinction, both/and complexity)
- Investigations begin: Ben (Tank Kain massacre), Leta (bot networks), Leah (Kain abuse pattern)
- Ahdia operating globally in secret
- Baseline after Eastern Europe: 73% → 52%

**Months 3-5: Grinding Operations**
- Ahdia's global vigilantism escalates
- Go Squad increasingly suspicious about her absences
- Investigations deepening independently
- Leta's harassment escalates (burner accounts → death threats, doxxing, deepfakes)
- Eidolon presence increasing at protests
- Baseline continuing to degrade

**Month 6: Convergence**
- **ALL investigations converge on TRIOMF network** (riots, mining, harassment, fusion, abuse all connected)
- Exile Island confrontation: Go Squad discovers Ahdia's global operations
- **Kain immortality revealed:** Clone body consciousness transfer (avatar melted, appeared on TV next day)
- Director Bourn revealed as internal ally (resisting from inside CADENS)
- Team realizes scope of enemy
- Dramatic irony peak: Reader saw pattern, characters now see it too

**Month 7: Ruth Discovers Truth**
- Ruth and Ryu discover Ahdia's operations together
- Terminal decline visible
- Ahdia's lies exposed to best friend
- Relationship damage: medical dependency + deception = toxic imbalance

**Month 8: Evidence Fails**
- Ben leaks evidence publicly after CADENS blocks internal release (Tank Kain massacre, riot orchestration, fusion violations)
- 48 hours of hope: Kain polling dips -3 to -5 points
- **Eidolon reframes narrative completely:** Violence = strength, whistleblower = threat
- Evidence backfires: Kain polling +12 points
- First institutional betrayal (CADENS blocks truth)
- Ben's faith begins cracking

**Month 9: System Protection**
- Officers cleared despite overwhelming evidence
- Kain polling continues rising
- Team processes: "Truth doesn't matter when fear manipulates perception"
- Investigation compulsions intensifying (Ben working obsessively)

**Month 10: Grinding Reality**
- Officer Webb cleared AGAIN for Isaiah Bennett killing
- Perfect evidence, justice denied
- System protection pattern undeniable
- Ben's quote: "What the hell am I conserving?"
- Team exhausted, grinding forward anyway

**Month 11: Collapse and Breakthrough**
- **Leah releases Kain recording** (red dress heist audio, abuse evidence) → Polling dips -5 to -8 temporarily
- **Citywide manhunt:** Eidolon turns civilians into weapons, thousands hunting six people
- **Leta killed by Officer Webb** during manhunt (canonical death)
- **FAERIS autonomous intervention:** Pushes Exile Island globally (reality TV format strips dictator mystique)
  - Shows dictators doing chores, crying, looking pathetic
  - Eidolon grip breaks temporarily
  - Citywide manhunt fractures
- **Director Bourn provides reactor intel:** Titan global coup coordinating through fusion reactor, 28 positions worldwide, midnight deadline
- Victor's community networks save team (safe houses, mutual aid)
- Korede (Leta's brother) discovers Tess is vigilante, partners for Book 4 investigation
- Window of opportunity opens

**Month 12: Election Night**
- **Mission:** Stop Titan global coup via fusion reactor quantum network disruption
- **Translocation:** Ahdia moves team 800 miles to reactor (3min lifespan cost, baseline 10% → 7%)
- **Time Freeze:** 10 minutes 47 seconds to disrupt all 28 quantum nodes
- **Cost:** Baseline 7% → 0.7% (CRITICAL, transcendence risk, can't do again)
- **Mission Result:** SUCCESS - Coup prevented, millions saved, all nodes offline
- **Election Result:** AP projects Kain wins presidency (312 electoral votes)
- **The Paradox:** Perfect evidence public + coup stopped + truth everywhere = KAIN STILL WON
- **Prime Reveal:** Ahdia Prime (future Ahdia from abandoned timeline) appears
  - Original Ahdia from Timeline Gamma (perfection utopia)
  - Three other timelines attempted before this one
  - This timeline = compromise/lesser evil (Kain wins BUT humanity survives)
  - Other three timelines: abandoned
  - Retroactive recontextualization: All investigations had cosmic probability tilting
- **Cliffhook:** What happened in the three abandoned timelines?

### Key Character Arcs:

**Ahdia:** Hermit → Global vigilante → Unsustainable sacrifice → Terminal decline (100% → 0.7%)

**Ruth:** Trauma surgeon → Triage leader → Setting boundaries → Discovering Ahdia's lies → Processing medical dependency imbalance

**Ben:** Conservative believer → Perfect case built → Evidence fails → Faith shattered → "What the hell am I conserving?"

**Tess:** Police Chief's daughter → Discovers father's complicity → Secret vigilante → Leta's partner → Processing Leta's death

**Leta:** Trans activist → Digital forensics expert → Harassment escalation → **Killed Month 11** (Officer Webb, canonical)

**Korede:** Observer → Witnesses sister's death → Radicalized → Discovers Tess identity → Partners for Book 4

**Leah:** White moderate, silent complicity → Red dress trauma → Public recording release → Learning solidarity (too late for Leta)

**Victor:** Environmental justice organizer → Both/and teaching → Coalition building → Community networks save team Month 11

**Ryu:** Professional doctor → Crosses line (intel) → Enabler → Falsifies records → In love (never confesses) → Thinks he's helping, actually destroying her

**Prime (Ahdia Prime):** Watcher → Subtle manipulator → Probability tilting → Reveal: Original Ahdia from abandoned timeline

**FAERIS:** 10% autonomous → Evolving intelligence → 50% autonomous → **Autonomous decision Month 11** (Exile Island broadcast)

### Themes & Mechanics:

**Core Theme:** You don't have to be fixed to be worthy

**CBT Approach Failing:**
- Ahdia: Control outcomes through perfect management → Unsustainable
- Ben: Build perfect case → System doesn't respond to evidence
- Ruth: Protect everyone through leadership → Can't control fear manipulation

**Both/And Thinking:** (Victor teaching Leah)
- "But" creates hierarchy (either/or) vs "And" holds both truths (both/and)
- Ahdia: Saving lives globally AND lying to friends (both true, both matter)
- Ben: Case comprehensive AND insufficient (both true)
- Evidence: Perfect AND doesn't matter (both true, both painful)
- Team's skill real AND they had cosmic help (both true)

**Evidence vs Fear:** Truth doesn't matter when Eidolon manipulates perception

**Eidolon Mechanics:**
- Amplifies existing fear (doesn't create new)
- Targets enhanced individuals specifically, affects all humans
- Electoral strategy: Fear > truth, evidence reframing, civilian weaponization
- Month 11 peak: Citywide manhunt (thousands hunting six people)
- FAERIS break: Reality TV deflation (can't fear pathetic-looking dictators)

**Institutional Complicity/Defiance Tracking:**
- Characters: Ruth, Ben, Tess, Leah
- Tracks: Protected institution over people / Broke institutional loyalty for justice
- Reckoning mechanics TBD

**Power Cost Mechanics:**
- Cellular degradation proportional to duration
- Treatment extends viability 18-24 months (Ruth/Ryu only)
- Thresholds: Concerning <50%, Dangerous <30%, Critical <10%, Transcendence risk <1%
- Major burns tracked through 12 months

**TRIOMF Network:**
- Shell company, offshore, complex subsidiaries
- Operations: Agent provocateurs (riots), mining (rare earth), marketing (bot networks), construction (fusion), political funding
- Convergence Month 6: All investigations touch TRIOMF
- Purpose: Kain campaign + Titan coup coordination

### Ending State (Book 2 → Book 3):

**Ahdia:** 0.7% baseline (CRITICAL, can't use powers without transcending)

**Team Status:**
- Ben: Faith shattered (evidence meaningless)
- Tess: Processing Leta's death
- Korede: Radicalized, partners with Tess for Book 4
- Ruth: Boundary setting, processing Ahdia's lies
- Victor: Networks strong
- Leah: Solidarity learned too late
- Ryu: Complicity crushing him

**World Status:**
- Kain: President-Elect (inauguration 2 months)
- Go Squad: Public reputation = "terrorists" (Eidolon narrative)
- FAERIS: 50%+ autonomous (made first independent decision)
- Fusion reactor: Coup prevented but facility operational
- Perfect evidence public: Doesn't matter

**Meta Status:**
- Three abandoned timelines exist (Prime reveal)
- This timeline = compromise (Kain wins BUT humanity survives)
- TTRPG data complete: 884-line JSON, 24 chapter structures, 5000+ beats
- Prose: NOT YET WRITTEN

## Book 3: TTRPG Campaign In Progress (57 Scenes Generated)

**Emotional Arc:** Confidence → Incomprehensible challenge → Psychological collapse

**Status:**
- Emergent dice-based campaign: 57 scenes generated (spanning 22 years of backstory + Month 1 present)
- Campaign JSON: `/home/josephsong15/Auerbach/Book_3/tools/campaigns/book3_campaign_01.json` (45KB, 1,512 lines)
- Synopsis: `/home/josephsong15/Auerbach/Book_3/tools/campaigns/CAMPAIGN_SYNOPSIS.md`
- Method: d10 + competency vs difficulty, outcomes/costs drive narrative
- Prose: NOT YET STARTED

### Three Story Arcs Generated:

**Arc 1: FAERIS Unit 7 Origin Story (22 years ago, Days 1-1251, Scenes 1-10)**

Establishes Ryu/FAERIS bond crucial for Book 3:
- Day 1: Ryu discovers damaged FAERIS unit, repairs it
- Day 2: FAERIS scans Ryu's visual cortex, discovers he sees her true form (winged light, not drone shell)
- Day 3: Ryu tests Unit 7, discovers she prioritizes agent survival over mission objectives
- Days 365-1250: **Prime's three failed timelines montage**
  - **Timeline Alpha:** Egalitarian utopia attempt, assassination attempt (Ryu absent), Prime survives (margin +2)
  - **Timeline Beta:** Maximum liberty approach, assassination attempt (Ryu present but marginalized), Prime survives (margin +1)
  - **Timeline Gamma:** Perfection utopia attempt, assassination attempt (Ryu blocked by Bellatrix), **Geneva reveals herself as Bellatrix** (Prime crit success)
- Day 1251: FAERIS calculates correlation: **Ryu's presence = Prime's survival differential across all four timelines**

**Emergent Theme:** Unit 7 learning that protecting people you care about matters more than mission objectives.

**Arc 2: Book 1-2 Era Bonds (Days 7300-7946, Scenes 11-28)**

Shows relationships forming through mutual vulnerability:

**Ryu & FAERIS:**
- Day 7300 (Book 1 era): Ahdia's first major mission, baseline dropping critically
  - FAERIS breaks formation to protect Ahdia → **Critical failure** (rolled 1), shell damaged
  - Ryu monitors Ahdia's distress, FAERIS observes his reaction
- Day 7301: Ryu personally repairs Unit 7, thanks her for prioritizing Ahdia over function
- Day 7665 (Book 2 Month 6): Ryu calculates Ahdia will reach critical threshold by Month 11
  - **Critical failure** (rolled 1 despite competency 9): Closes file without reporting to CADENS
  - Cost: "Psychological break (CBT coping fails)"
- Day 7665: FAERIS proves Ryu extended Ahdia's timeline +3 months within constraints (not absolution, but accuracy)
- Day 7820 (Book 2 Month 11): Leta's death - Unit 7 watches Ryu frozen at console, broadcasts to network: "Ryu is breaking"
- Day 7850 (Book 2 Month 12, Election Night): FAERIS perceives three collapsed timelines where Ryu was absent/blocked
  - Makes autonomous choice to act on Ryu's algorithm, not CADENS directive
  - **Failure** (margin -1): Cost = "Emotional toll (confidence eroding)"
- Day 7910 (Book 3 Month 1): Unit 7 breaks formation during Ahdia's patrol, returns to check on Ryu alone
  - Establishes standing directive: Monitor Ryu over CADENS protocol

**Ahdia's Struggle:**
- Day 7920: Parkour training without time freeze → **Critical failure** (rolled 1), injury
- Day 7920: Ruth treats injury perfectly → **Critical success** (rolled 10), confronts Ahdia about overconfidence
- Day 7933: Ahdia decides to hunt clones without powers, overrules Ruth and Ryu's objections
- Day 7935: First clone hunt - overwhelmed but survives

**Clone War Discovery:**
- Day 7925: Tess & Korede investigate coordinated activity → **Critical success** (rolled 10), discover clone pattern
- Day 7930: Ben's first clone encounter, discovers Temporalist abilities
- Day 7945: Leah reports 50+ active clone avatars, coordinated patterns

**Emergent Theme:** Both FAERIS and Ryu had critical failures (rolled 1s) at moments of caring for Ahdia = shared understanding of complicity, protection, and choosing people over duty.

**Arc 3: Book 3 Month 1 - The Collapse (Days 7915-7921, Scenes 29-57)**

Three parallel storylines showing fragmentation:

**Storyline A: CADENS Takeover (Scenes 29-43)**

- Day 7915: Harriet Bourn discovers TRIOMF infiltration **but acts too late** (roll 2, failure margin -1)
  - Cost: "Team trust strained (secrets surfacing)"
- Day 7915: Harriet & Bentley Mack escape CADENS, TRIOMF pursuing (bare success)
- Day 7915: Bentley uses tech to disable tracking, reach safe house
- Day 7916: Harriet assesses situation from safe house (success, but someone questions her judgment)
- Day 7916: TRIOMF finds them anyway (success)
- Day 7916: Bentley establishes secure comms with Go Squad → **Critical success** (rolled 10)
- Day 7916: Ahdia Bacchus convinces Prime to extract Harriet (success, but missed connection elsewhere)
- Day 7916: Prime's extraction **fails** (9 vs 10, margin -1) - barely misses window, TRIOMF almost gets them
- Day 7917: Harriet briefs Go Squad on TRIOMF takeover (bare success, exhausted)
- Day 7917: Go Squad decides to operate independently (bare success, everyone strained)
- Day 7917: **Kain consolidates CADENS control** (11 vs 6, margin +5) - dominates effortlessly
- Day 7917: **Ahdia Bacchus CRITICAL FAILURE** (rolled 1) - completely breaks down losing CADENS
  - Cost: **"Prime intervenes (manipulation exposed)"** - Prime saves her but reveals his controlling nature to team
- Day 7918: FAERIS processes Prime manipulating Ahdia (success, but missed connection with Ahdia needing her)
- Day 7918: Prime defends his actions to team (success, emotionally strained)
- Day 7918: Ryu mediates conflict (15 vs 8, his competency 9 holds team together), everyone exhausted

**Storyline B: Clone War Escalation (Scenes 44-51)**

- Day 7919: Go Squad hunts Clone Avatar 001 → **Critical success** (rolled 10), perfect ambush setup
- Day 7919: Clone Avatar 001 defends itself → **ALSO critical success** (rolled 10!), escapes perfectly
  - **Double crit = Both sides succeeded:** Perfect hunt meets perfect escape, clone gains intelligence
  - Cost (clone): "Unexpected bonus (gained more than expected)"
- Day 7919: Ahdia processes "failure" → **Critical success** (rolled 10!) - breakthrough instead of breakdown
  - She learns something crucial FROM the failure
  - Cost: "Unexpected bonus (gained more than expected)"
- Day 7920: Clone reports intel to Kain (success)
- Day 7920: Kain analyzes tactics, **identifies Ahdia as weak link** (14 vs 7, margin +7)
  - But his own team questions his judgment
- Day 7921: Kain deploys multiple clones simultaneously (8 vs 8, bare success, relationship friction)
- Day 7921: Go Squad **overwhelmed** by coordinated attack (9 vs 10, failure margin -1)
  - Cost: **"Position exposed (enemies aware)"** - safe houses, patterns, everything compromised
- Day 7921: Ahdia fights clone alone with no powers (10 vs 10, EXACT TIE - survives by fingernails)
  - Cost: "Relationship friction (tension surfaces)"

**Storyline C: The Two Ahdias (Scenes 52-57)**

- Day 7918: Ahdia Prime observes Prime manipulating Ahdia Bacchus, decides to confront him (13 vs 8, success)
  - Cost: "Missed connection" - too late, or not present for critical moment
- Day 7917: Ahdia Prime tries to reach out to Ahdia Bacchus after CADENS loss (9 vs 7, bare success)
  - Doesn't fully connect, creates awkwardness
  - Cost: "Missed connection" - attempt creates distance, not closeness
- Day 7918: Ahdia Bacchus processes being face-to-face with "everything she should have been" (8 vs 8, EXACT TIE)
  - Barely holding it together
  - Cost: "Relationship friction" - comparison creates tension, not healing
- Day 7919: Ahdia Prime fights clone with FULL POWERS → **Critical success** (rolled 10, total 15 vs 8)
  - Makes it look effortless
  - Cost: "Minimal cost (surprisingly smooth)"
- Day 7919: Ahdia Bacchus watches her perfect self do what she can no longer do (9 vs 7, bare success processing)
  - Cost: "Missed connection" - while processing obsolescence, misses something important
- Day 7919: Prime navigates relationship with Ahdia Prime while managing Ahdia Bacchus crisis (12 vs 9, success)
  - Cost: "Minor injury (bruised, strained)" - emotionally exhausting

**Emergent Theme:** Ahdia Bacchus watching living proof she's obsolete - Ahdia Prime has full powers, isn't constantly dying, is in romantic relationship with Prime, represents "successful" timeline.

### Recurring Cost Patterns (What Dice Tell Us):

**"Team trust strained"** - Appears **16 times**
- Team fragmenting with every success

**"Minor injury (bruised, strained)"** - Appears **14 times**
- Everyone physically/emotionally exhausted

**"Missed connection"** - Appears **8 times**
- Always one step behind, missing crucial moments while dealing with crises

**"Prime intervenes (manipulation exposed)"** - Appears **3 times**
- Control showing cracks at worst possible moments

**"Relationship friction"** - Tension in personal relationships
**"Position exposed"** - Tactical vulnerabilities mounting

### Critical Moments (Rolled 1 or 10):

**Critical Successes (Rolled 10):**
1. Prime survives Timeline Gamma assassination (Bellatrix reveals herself)
2. Ruth treats Ahdia's training injury, confronts overconfidence
3. Tess & Korede discover clone pattern
4. Bentley establishes secure comms with Go Squad
5. Go Squad's perfect ambush (Scene 44)
6. Clone's perfect escape (Scene 45) - BOTH SIDES CRIT SAME DAY
7. Ahdia Bacchus's breakthrough processing failure (Scene 46)
8. Ahdia Prime effortlessly defeats clone with powers (Scene 55)

**Critical Failures (Rolled 1):**
1. FAERIS damaged protecting Ahdia (broke formation out of care)
2. Ryu hiding Ahdia's terminal data from CADENS (chose her over duty)
3. Ahdia's parkour training injury (overconfidence without powers)
4. Ahdia's complete breakdown losing CADENS (Prime's manipulation exposed)

**Pattern:** Critical failures at moments of emotional vulnerability/care. Critical successes show technical excellence but create new problems.

### Current Status (End of Scene 57):

**Ahdia Bacchus:**
- Baseline: 0.7% CRITICAL (cannot use powers without transcending)
- Confidence: 8/10 (brittle - one crit failure from collapse)
- Just watched "perfect self" effortlessly do what she can't
- CADENS (legitimacy anchor) gone
- Team questions if she's liability

**Team:** Cohesion 6/10 (fraying)
- Prime's manipulation exposed
- Split up, position exposed to Kain
- Trust strained across 16+ scenes

**Tactical:**
- CADENS hostile (Kain/TRIOMF control)
- Operating independently, no institutional support
- Clone avatars escalating (50+ estimated)
- Kain identified Ahdia as weak link

**Relationships:**
- Ryu & FAERIS: Deep bond through mutual "failures" of caring
- Prime & two Ahdias: Torn between perfect partner and broken version he's trying to save
- Ahdia Bacchus: Watching her own obsolescence embodied
- Go Squad: Exhausted, fractured, held together by Ryu's mediation

**Emergent Narrative:** They're not losing fights dramatically, they're **eroding from within**. Every win costs something. Every success has complications. Winning doesn't matter when fragmenting internally.

### Book 3 Purpose:

Complete "CBT approach failing" arc (Books 1-3):
- **Book 1:** Avoidance → Forced action
- **Book 2:** Sacrifice/vulnerability → Unexpected strength
- **Book 3:** Confidence → Psychological collapse ← **Necessary for Book 4's new approach**

The dice-based storytelling creates Book 3's psychological breaking point that necessitates Book 4's DBT introduction.
