- Every "safe" location compromised
- Team capable of surviving with Diana's secret help

- Victor: Crit Fail → Crit Success (most dramatic save)
- Leah: Failures even with help (Eidolon influence)
- Korede: Failures leading to injury

**Pattern Continuation:**
- Ch9: Antagonist (Fear army creation)
- Ch10: Antagonist (Bellatrix's motives/test decision)
- Ch11: Heroes (scattered escape, Diana's secret saves them)
- Breaking pattern with two antagonist chapters shows escalation
