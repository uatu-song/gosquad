# CLAUDE.md - Book 3

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working on Book 3 of the Auerbach Series.

## Book 3 Overview

**Status:** Planning / Pre-production

**Emotional Arc:** Confidence → Incomprehensible challenge → Psychological collapse

**Thematic Focus:** CBT approach final failure - Ahdia's confidence from Book 2 victory is shattered by incomprehensible challenge

**Chess Structure:** TBD - Game selection in progress

## Character Voice System

Ahdia's voice evolves subtly across the series while maintaining core patterns.

**Core Identity (Book 3):**
- Has gained confidence from Book 2 (finally feels capable)
- Still uses TV as primary frame of reference
- Powers more familiar but costs escalating
- **Faces challenge so incomprehensible it breaks her psychologically**

**Voice remains consistent with established patterns. See `/Writing_Guide/Voice_and_Style/Ahdia_Voice_Checklist.md` for complete guidelines.**

## Seven-Book Context

Book 3 completes the "CBT approach failing" arc (Books 1-3).

**Book 1:** Avoidance → Forced action ✓
**Book 2:** Sacrifice/vulnerability → Unexpected strength ✓
**Book 3:** Confidence → Psychological collapse ← You are here
**Book 4:** Turning point (stalemate, DBT introduction)
**Books 5-7:** DBT approach succeeding

**Critical Importance:** Book 3 must establish Ahdia's psychological breaking point that necessitates the new approach introduced in Book 4.

## Quality Checks & Golden Rules

**See Book 2 CLAUDE.md for complete checklists**

Key reminders:
- Maintain Ahdia's established voice patterns
- Chess structure provides pacing, not plot
- Emotional truth > mechanical truth
- Ground cosmic elements in casual language
- Trust reader intelligence

---

**Remember:** Book 3 is where the old approach definitively fails. This collapse is necessary to enable Books 4-7's transformation.
