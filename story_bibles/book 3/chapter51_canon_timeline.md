# CHAPTER 51 CANON TIMELINE

*Canon event sequence - to be converted to beats when reached*

---

## The Sequence

1. **Ahdia already in The Between with AR-Ryu alive** (he's been with her this whole time via visor)

2. **First kaiju rescue happens** (earlier chapter, not Chapter 51)
   - "Just a small kaiju" approaches Ahdia
   - Suzie + Pio drop in to save her
   - Suzie uses harpoon weapon - fires, retrieves, reusable
   - Establishes harpoon as key survival tool
   - "Seventeen. You okay down there?"
   - First meeting between Ahdia and Suzie

3. **Chapter 51 starts AFTER that rescue**
   - Already inside Pio's two-seater cockpit
   - AR-Ryu alive and visible via visor throughout
   - Active participant in all planning and collaboration

4. **Beacon collaboration with all three**
   - Ahdia + Suzie + AR-Ryu working together
   - AR-Ryu contributing calculations and ideas
   - Morse code message: "SOS + coordinates + OPEN RIFT"
   - Visor battery dropping throughout (18% → declining)
   - No memory storage - all data volatile

5. **Earth team receives signal**
   - Cryptic morse code, can't verify sender
   - Team debates risk vs faith
   - Choose to open rift (supernova danger if kept open too long)
   - Ryu stands by ready to receive upload if it's Ahdia
   - Don't send rescue party through (too risky)

6. **Rift opens, plan to escape together**
   - All three (Ahdia + Suzie + AR-Ryu) planning to reach rift in Pio
   - Kaiju pack attacks during dash to rift
   - Multiple enemies, rift closing, won't make it in time

7. **Suzie's desperate multi-stage improvisation:**
   - **Stage 1: Eject first**
     - Suzie hits ejection button
     - Launches Ahdia UP in co-pilot ejector seat
     - AR-Ryu still with Ahdia (via visor)

   - **Stage 2: Fire harpoon**
     - While Ahdia airborne, Suzie fires harpoon through rift
     - Harpoon passes through to Earth side
     - Cable unspooling from Pio

   - **Stage 3: Detach cable**
     - Uses Pio's mech arms to disconnect cable from mech
     - Cable now free, connected only to rift-side harpoon
     - Coiling cable in mech hands

   - **Stage 4: Ejection arc**
     - Ahdia reaches apex, starts falling back down
     - Cable almost at full extension
     - Running out of line

   - **Stage 5: The throw**
     - Suzie throws coiled cable + tow hook at falling ejection seat
     - Right before cable completely unspools
     - Hook snags ejection seat at last second
     - Harpoon line yanks Ahdia toward rift

8. **Ahdia dragged toward and through rift**
   - Being pulled at high speed by harpoon line
   - Suzie turns Pio to face kaiju - last stand
   - Sounds of combat behind
   - Ahdia can't look back, being dragged forward
   - Crosses rift threshold to Earth

9. **AR-Ryu dies RIGHT THEN**
   - Powers flood back into Ahdia
   - Sees Ryu below, waiting, ready to receive upload
   - AR-Ryu: "Ahdia! I can see him! Tell him I loved—"
   - Visor battery: 0% - SHUTTING DOWN
   - AR-Ryu erased mid-sentence
   - Right before upload connection could establish
   - **Seconds too late**
   - All data erased

10. **Landing and aftermath**
    - Ahdia uses temporal freeze to stop momentum
    - Lands safely on Earth
    - Ryu was standing by - missed upload by seconds
    - Team reunion: joy turning to grief
    - Must explain: AR-Ryu erased right before upload, Suzie sacrificed herself
    - Dead visor only evidence
    - Incomplete last words: "Tell him I loved—" WHAT?
    - Ryu will never know
    - Only Ahdia's memories remain

## Key Elements

**Harpoon:**
- Reusable weapon shown in earlier kaiju rescue
- Suzie's most reliable survival tool
- Sacrifices it for Ahdia's escape (can't get it back)
- "Something that matters"

**AR-Ryu:**
- Alive throughout entire Chapter 51
- Active participant in planning
- Contributes to beacon encoding
- Witnesses Suzie's sacrifice
- Dies at worst possible moment (right before upload)
- Mid-sentence: "Tell him I loved—"
- Forever incomplete

**Timing Tragedy:**
- AR-Ryu didn't die in The Between
- Survived entire journey
- Made it to Earth
- Saw Ryu waiting
- Started final message
- Battery died RIGHT THEN
- Missed upload by literal seconds
- Ryu was ready to receive
- Ultimate cruel timing

**Suzie's Sacrifice:**
- Multi-stage desperate improvisation
- Gave up reusable harpoon (survival tool)
- Fought kaiju alone to buy time
- Fate ambiguous (likely dead or trapped)
- From erased timeline (Iteration 3)
- Now erased again
