## KEY SCENES

### Chapter 43: The Rescue

**Setup:** Ahdia about to be eaten by kaiju, grieving AR-Ryu

```
[Kaiju lunging at Ahdia]

[SUDDEN: Missile impact, explosion]

[Pioneer drops from above - battle-scarred, white/red colors
 faded, patches visible, but FUNCTIONAL]

TROUBLEMAKER (over speaker): "Hey ugly! Over here!"

[Kaiju turns. Pioneer lands, energy blade activating]

TROUBLEMAKER: "That's right. Come get some."

[Combat: Efficient, brutal, practiced. Troublemaker's fought
 these before. Energy blade through kaiju skull. It drops.]

[Pioneer stands over dead kaiju]

TROUBLEMAKER: "Seventeen."

[Cockpit opens. Woman climbing out - flight suit worn,
 short hair, tired but alert, tool belt, weapons]

TROUBLEMAKER: [calling down] "You okay down there?"

AHDIA: [staring up, disbelief] "You... saved me."

TROUBLEMAKER: [jumping down, landing] "Yeah. Couldn't let it
              eat you. Bad for the neighborhood."

[Extends hand]

TROUBLEMAKER: "Callsign: Troublemaker. You can call me
              that or Suzie. Whatever."

AHDIA: [taking hand] "Ahdia. Thank you."

TROUBLEMAKER: [pulling her up] "Don't mention it."

[Looks at dead AR-Ryu unit nearby]

TROUBLEMAKER: "AR unit? I'm sorry."

AHDIA: [grief flashing] "He was... yes."

TROUBLEMAKER: "I know that feeling. Lost my whole squadron."

[Beat]

TROUBLEMAKER: "You're new here, aren't you?"

AHDIA: "Here being...?"

TROUBLEMAKER: "The Between. The place you end up when your
              world stops existing."
```

---

### Chapter 44: Stories Exchanged

**Ahdia and Troublemaker bonding**

```
AHDIA: "How long have you been here?"

TROUBLEMAKER: "Lost count. Years probably. Time's weird here."

AHDIA: "Years? Alone?"

TROUBLEMAKER: [gestures to Pioneer] "Not completely alone.
              Pio keeps me company. Her AI still works.
              Mostly."

AHDIA: "Pioneer?"

TROUBLEMAKER: "My mech. Pio for short. She's gotten me through
              seventeen kaiju, three dimension-worms, and
              something I'm calling a void squid."

AHDIA: "Seventeen?"

TROUBLEMAKER: "Just the small ones. The big ones I avoid.
              I'm a troublemaker, not an idiot."

[Ahdia almost smiles]

TROUBLEMAKER: "So. Your turn. How'd you end up here?"

AHDIA: "Someone forced me through a rift. A cosmic entity."

TROUBLEMAKER: "Ouch. Me? My entire world just... ended.
              Mid-mission. One moment I'm on patrol,
              next moment everything's gone and I'm here."

AHDIA: "Your world ended?"

TROUBLEMAKER: "Yeah. I didn't understand why until recently."

[Beat]

TROUBLEMAKER: "You said something about timelines earlier.
              About someone time traveling. Erasing worlds."

AHDIA: [carefully] "Yes. Someone from my team.
       She's from another timeline. She time traveled
       to save our world. But to do that, she had to...
       erase other versions."

TROUBLEMAKER: [very still] "How many?"

AHDIA: "Three. Three Earths."

TROUBLEMAKER: "Which one was mine?"

AHDIA: "I... I'd have to ask her. But you said your world
       almost succeeded. That it was stable."

TROUBLEMAKER: "Six months. We thought we'd made it."

AHDIA: "Iteration 3. That was you."

TROUBLEMAKER: [quiet] "Iteration 3."

[Long silence]

TROUBLEMAKER: "We were so close. We really thought we'd done it."

AHDIA: "I'm sorry."

TROUBLEMAKER: "Not your fault. But your friend?
              We're going to have words when I meet her."
```

### Chapter 50: Confronting Diana

**After rescue, on Earth**

```
[Resistance HQ. Team celebrating Ahdia's return. Pioneer
 landed outside, Troublemaker climbing out.]

DIANA: [seeing Troublemaker, freezes]

TROUBLEMAKER: [walking toward group, stops when she sees Diana]

[Long moment. Everyone feels tension.]

DIANA: "You're from Iteration 3."

TROUBLEMAKER: "How do you know that?"

DIANA: "Because I'm the one who erased it."

[Silence. Team tense. Troublemaker very still.]

TROUBLEMAKER: "Say that again."

DIANA: "I time traveled. To save this Earth, I had to erase
       three others. Yours was the third."

TROUBLEMAKER: [quiet, dangerous] "You destroyed my world."

DIANA: "Yes."

TROUBLEMAKER: "My squadron. My family. My entire planet.
              Six months of utopia. We thought we'd WON."

DIANA: "I know. I'm sorry."

TROUBLEMAKER: [stepping closer] "You're SORRY?"

RUTH: [moving between them] "Troublemaker—"

TROUBLEMAKER: "Don't." [To Diana] "Do you know what it's like?
              Fighting kaiju alone for years?
              Talking to a damaged AI because there's no one else?
              Wondering if you'll ever see another human?"

DIANA: [tears streaming] "I didn't know anyone survived—"

TROUBLEMAKER: "You didn't CHECK."

[Beat - rage barely controlled]

TROUBLEMAKER: "You know what's funny? My callsign is Troublemaker.
              I got it for causing problems, not following orders.
              But you? YOU'RE the real troublemaker here.
              You broke THREE WORLDS."

DIANA: "I know."

TROUBLEMAKER: "Do you? Really?"

[Looking around at team]

TROUBLEMAKER: "This is the person you trust? The one who
              erases worlds to save her own?"

AHDIA: "She stopped me from doing the same thing."

TROUBLEMAKER: [looking at Ahdia] "What?"

AHDIA: "I was about to time travel. She stopped me.
       Told me it doesn't work. That it just makes things worse.
       She broke the cycle."

TROUBLEMAKER: [to Diana] "How many would there have been?"

DIANA: "If I hadn't stopped her? If she'd kept trying?
       Dozens. Maybe hundreds. I tried four times.
       She would have tried too."

TROUBLEMAKER: [long silence, processing]

TROUBLEMAKER: "Three's bad enough. But at least you stopped."

[Beat]

TROUBLEMAKER: "I'm not forgiving you. I can't.
              You took everything from me."

DIANA: "I understand."

TROUBLEMAKER: "But you got me out of that place.
              And you stopped it from happening again."

[Extends hand]

TROUBLEMAKER: "Captain Suzie Rivets. Canadian Mech Corps.
              From a world that doesn't exist anymore."

DIANA: [taking hand] "Diana. The person who erased it."

TROUBLEMAKER: "We're going to have a complicated relationship."

DIANA: "I know."

TROUBLEMAKER: "Good. Now where's the beer in this timeline?
              Because after years in The Between,
              I could use about twelve."
