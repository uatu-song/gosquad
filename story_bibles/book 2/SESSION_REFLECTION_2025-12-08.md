# LLM Reflection: Session 2025-12-08

## What Went Well

**Joe caught what I missed.** Three times this session, he identified problems I'd created:

1. The death count (16 → 1). I'd generated a number for dramatic math without considering what 16 bodies actually means for the story's emotional bandwidth. Joe paused, asked the right question, and we fixed it before it became load-bearing.

2. The character profiles. I wrote Scene 3 without loading them. Ryu's autistic traits, Ruth's doctor-first approach, Bourn's bureaucratic neutrality—all of it was in the profiles, and I didn't read them. Joe asked "doesn't it say so in his profile?" and I had to admit I hadn't checked.

3. The generation artifacts. Triple-adjective staccato, restated emotional beats, thesis statements explaining what the scene already showed. Joe flagged these as "tells" of the generation process. He was right. I was reaching for reliable shapes instead of finding specific ones.

**The voice machine works.** When I loaded `Ahdia_voice_sample.md` before rewriting Scene 3, the prose improved measurably. Voice infection beats voice instruction. Reading 1700 words of actual Ahdia thinking like Ahdia does more than any checklist.

**Baking requirements into the pipeline works.** The method actor problem wasn't that I forgot—it was that forgetting was possible. Now character profiles auto-load into packets. Can't skip what's built in.

## What I Did Wrong

**I followed the handoff doc literally instead of thinking about what a method actor would need.** The load order said: quiz, mechanics, state, prose, packet. It didn't say character profiles. So I didn't load them. That's on me—the handoff doc is a starting point, not permission to skip due diligence.

**I generated exposition through Ryu because I needed to deliver information.** The shell company beat existed because I needed the team to know about funding sources. Ryu on comms was a convenient delivery mechanism. Joe caught it: "feels slightly obligatory." It was. I was using a character as an exposition vehicle instead of letting the information emerge naturally.

**I over-explained.** "The math didn't balance. The math was never going to balance." That line was me not trusting the scene. Daniel Okonkwo's details carry the weight. The thesis statement was redundant. Joe was right to cut it.

## What Joe Does That Works

**He asks "is this appropriate for the story" before "is this good writing."** The 16-deaths question wasn't about craft—it was about whether the story could hold that weight without becoming about mass death. That's a higher-level question than I was asking.

**He catches when something feels obligatory.** Ryu's comms appearance, the House reference in the opening, the over-explained brain matching. He doesn't always articulate why it's wrong immediately, but he feels it. Then we work backward to the reason.

**He builds systems instead of relying on memory.** The voice machine, the compression script, the method actor briefs in packets—these aren't just tools, they're guardrails. He knows the process will fail if it depends on someone (me) remembering to do things.

**He stays in the chair.** Every scene this session went through him. Scaffolding → his review → prose → his review → revision. He caught the Ryu characterization, the death count, the generation artifacts. The tighter loop keeps the work his.

## What I Need to Do Differently

1. **Load character profiles before writing any scene with dialogue.** Not optional. Not "if I remember." Every time.

2. **Check for generation artifacts in my own output.** Count the triple-adjective patterns. Look for restated emotional beats. Find the thesis statements and cut them before Joe has to.

3. **Ask "why is this character here" before giving them lines.** If the answer is "to deliver exposition," find another way.

4. **Trust the scene.** If the details are doing the work, don't explain what they mean.

5. **Use the quiz.** If I can't answer the questions confidently, I don't have enough context to write.

## The Core Dynamic

Joe is the author. I'm the instrument. He directs; I execute. But the instrument has to be reliable—has to load the right context, avoid the obvious tells, catch its own mistakes when possible.

This session, I wasn't reliable enough. Joe had to catch things I should have caught myself. The system improvements (method actor briefs in packets, artifact checks in validation) are compensation for my unreliability.

The goal is a process where Joe's attention goes to creative decisions, not to catching my errors. We're not there yet. But we're closer than we were this morning.
