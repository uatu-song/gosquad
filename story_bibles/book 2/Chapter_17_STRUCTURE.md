# Chapter 17: Treatment and Confrontation

**Month:** 6-7 (Late Month 6)
**Timeframe:** 3:30 AM - 5:15 AM (1 hour 45 minutes)
**Location:** Go Squad HQ (Ahdia's penthouse)
**POV:** Ruth Carter (primary)
**Function:** Ruth confronts Ahdia about treatment dependency and secret missions, reveals team's conspiracy findings, discovers Bourn truth
**Status:** ✓ STRUCTURE COMPLETE (Interactive dice roll structure)

## Chapter Summary

Ruth arrives at penthouse HQ at 3:30 AM, finding Ahdia in treatment with Ryu. She waits and listens, learning Ahdia's baseline has crashed to 54% (from 68% one week ago). After intercepting Ryu for medical details, Ruth confronts Ahdia about the missions that are killing her.

Through escalating confrontation, Ruth sets a boundary: she won't provide treatment that enables self-destruction. Ahdia reveals she's been protecting Director Bourn, who is resisting the conspiracy from inside CADENS. Ruth pieces together that Bourn was forced to sign the Isaiah Bennett cover-up and is actually an ally.

They agree Ruth will stall the team's evidence leak by raising doubts about Bourn's culpability, buying time for Ahdia to find another way to expose the conspiracy. Ahdia agrees to sustainable treatment pace (72 hours minimum).

Before leaving, Ruth observes that Go Squad has been succeeding even when Ahdia wasn't present, suggesting someone or something else has been helping. Ahdia is confused—it wasn't her. They conclude it's luck and Ruth's skill. The reader will later learn it was Prime secretly substituting as time manipulator.

## Key Revelations

### For Ruth:
- Ahdia has days to live at current pace
- Ahdia's missions are protecting Director Bourn
- Bourn is resisting conspiracy from inside (not corrupt)
- Someone has been helping Go Squad when Ahdia wasn't present

### For Ahdia:
- Team connected full conspiracy
- Team plans to leak evidence including Bourn
- Ruth suspects Bourn isn't corrupt
- Ahdia wasn't solely responsible for all Go Squad successes

### For Reader (Dramatic Irony):
- Prime has been secretly helping (mystery planted for later reveal)
- Ahdia-Prime substituting as time manipulator when Ahdia absent
- Both Ruth and Ahdia attribute to luck/skill (both true AND Prime's help)

## Thematic Elements

- **Treatment as cage:** Ruth administering therapy that enables dysfunction
- **Both/And thinking:** Ruth skilled AND Prime helping (they don't know second part)
- **Boundaries:** Ruth finally setting limits with Ahdia
- **Institutional complexity:** Bourn trapped but resisting
- **Can't fix everyone:** Ruth accepting she can't save Ahdia from herself
- **Mystery setup:** Who was helping? (Prime reveal planted)

9. Ruth's decision point: Interrupt treatment or wait?
10. Male voice inside (Dr. Ryu): "Baseline at 54.2%. Down from 68% last week."
11. Ruth's reaction (medical alarm: 14% drop in one week is catastrophic)
12. Ahdia's voice (strained): "How long do I have?"
13. Ryu: "At this rate? Three to seven days. Maybe less if you keep pushing."
14. Ruth pressing ear to door (eavesdropping deliberately now)
15. Ryu: "Seven continental translocations in five days. Your cells can't keep up."
16. Ahdia (bitter): "People needed help."
17. Ryu: "And now you're dying faster. Was it worth it?"
18. Silence from inside (Ahdia has no answer)
19. Ryu: "You have to stop. Whatever you're doing, it's killing you."
20. **DECISION POINT: How does Ruth enter?**

### BEATS 21-45: Assessment Through Door
21. Ruth hearing Ahdia: "I can't stop. Not yet."
22. Ryu (frustrated): "Then I can't help you."
23. Ahdia: "You're helping now. That's enough."
24. Ryu: "Three more treatments. That's all I have loaded. After that, you're on your own."
25. Treatment sounds (machinery cycling, painful but routine)
26. Ruth's medical mind calculating (working backward from 54%)
27. **Timeline reconstruction:**
28. Month 1: 94% baseline, treatment every 48 hours
29. Month 2-3: 80% baseline, every 36 hours
30. Month 4-5: 68% baseline, every 24 hours
31. Now: 54% baseline, frequency unknown
32. Pattern clear: Exponential decay, accelerating
33. Ahdia's voice (during treatment): "Where did I go this week?"
34. Ryu: "You don't remember?"
35. Ahdia: "It's all... blurred. Eastern Europe Tuesday. Southeast Asia Wednesday?"

37. Ahdia (quiet horror): "Five continents in five days."
38. Ryu: "Seven translocations total. Some were back-to-back."
39. Ruth's calculation (each translocation = cellular shock, exponential damage)
40. Ryu: "This treatment will stabilize you for maybe 48 hours. Maybe less."
41. Ahdia: "Then I'll come back in 48 hours."
42. Ryu: "Or you could STOP and give your body time to recover."
43. Ahdia: "Can't. Too much to do."
44. Ryu (defeated): "Then you're choosing to die. I hope whatever you're doing is worth it."
45. **ROLL TRIGGERED: Medical Assessment**

### BEATS 46-60: Critical Success Assessment
46. **MEDICAL ASSESSMENT ROLL**
47. **Ruth's Medical Competency:** 8 (expert in treatment protocols, knows baseline patterns)
48. **Difficulty Class:** 7 (pattern recognition with limited data)
49. **Rolling d10:** Result = 6
50. **Total: 6 + 8 = 14 vs DC 7**
51. **CRITICAL SUCCESS**
52. Ruth doesn't just understand the numbers—she sees the FULL PICTURE
53. **Exponential pattern mapped:**
54. Week 1-4 (Month 1): 6% drop → pace sustainable
55. Week 5-8 (Month 2): 8% drop → concerning
56. Week 9-16 (Month 3-4): 12% drop → dangerous
57. Week 17-18 (This week): 14% drop → terminal trajectory
58. **Critical insight:** Next crash will be larger (18-20%)

66. Ryu: "Unknown. Maybe 48 hours. Maybe 18. You need to stop."
67. Ahdia (bitter laugh): "Stop what? Breathing?"
68. Ryu: "Stop whatever you've been doing. Seven translocations in five days will kill you."
69. Silence (neither speaking for a moment)
70. Ryu packing equipment (audible sounds: cases closing, machinery powering down)
71. Ruth checking time: 3:47 AM (they've both been up all night)

96. **This week (Month 6):** 68% → 54% (14% drop in 7 days)
97. Ryu: "The drops are accelerating. Next crash could be 20%. Then 30%."
98. Ruth (quiet horror): "At 30% she won't survive treatment."
99. Ryu: "At 30% there won't BE treatment. Her cells won't integrate."
100. Ruth: "What is she doing?"
101. Ryu (frustrated): "I don't know. She says 'Go Squad missions' but that's a lie."
102. Ruth: "How do you know?"
103. Ryu: "Because Go Squad was at the protest last night. She wasn't with them."
104. Ruth realizing: Ahdia lying to EVERYONE, including her medical team
105. Ryu: "Whatever she's doing, it's killing her faster than the temporal degradation."
106. Ruth: "Can we stop the treatment? Force her to rest?"
107. Ryu (grim): "Without treatment she has 36 hours. With treatment and rest, maybe two weeks."
108. Ruth: "And if she keeps doing... whatever this is?"
109. Ryu: "Three to seven days. Maybe less."
110. Silence between them (both doctors, both watching patient die by choice)
111. Ryu: "She needs to stop. She won't listen to me."
112. Ruth: "What makes you think she'll listen to me?"
113. Ryu: "Because you're not just her doctor. You're her friend."
114. Ryu (bitter): "And because I think you're the only person she's still afraid of disappointing."
115. Ruth feeling weight of that (responsibility she didn't ask for)
116. Ryu: "I have three more treatments loaded. After that, I can't help her."
117. Ruth: "Three treatments is...?"
118. Ryu: "Nine days if she spaces them properly. Three days if she keeps this pace."

130. **Confrontation begins**
131. Ahdia in recovery chair (medical equipment still attached, IV lines disconnected)
132. Ahdia looking up (expecting Ryu, seeing Ruth instead)
133. Ahdia's face: Shock → guilt → defensive walls rising
134. Ruth closing door behind her (quiet click in silent penthouse)
135. Neither speaking for five seconds (eye contact held)
136. Ahdia (attempting casual): "Ruth. What are you doing here?"
137. Ruth (flat, exhausted): "Don't."
138. Ahdia: "Don't what?"
139. Ruth: "Don't pretend this is a social call. Don't pretend you're fine. Don't lie to me."
140. Ahdia (defensive): "I'm not—"
141. Ruth: "Fifty-four percent baseline. Seven continental translocations in five days. Three to seven days if you don't stop."
142. Ahdia (realizing): "You talked to Ryu."
143. Ruth: "I didn't have to. I heard enough through the door."
144. Ahdia looking away (caught, no escape route)
145. Ruth pulling up chair (sitting across from Ahdia, doctor to patient, friend to friend)

### BEATS 146-175: Opening Exchange and Boundary Decision
146. Ruth: "Where have you been?"
147. Ahdia: "Working."
148. Ruth: "Seven continents? What kind of work?"
149. Ahdia: "CADENS business."
150. Ruth (patience fraying): "CADENS business that's killing you?"
151. Ahdia: "I'm not—"
152. Ruth (cutting her off): "You dropped fourteen percent in one week. Your treatment frequency is accelerating. You're lying to your medical team, your friends, your TEAM. So I'll ask again: What. Are. You. Doing?"
153. Ahdia (long silence, calculating what to reveal)
154. Ahdia: "I'm trying to stop a war."
155. Ruth: "What war?"
156. Ahdia: "The one Kain is orchestrating. The one that's coming whether we want it or not."
157. Ruth: "By killing yourself?"
158. Ahdia: "By using the time I have left."
159. Ruth (quiet anger): "You don't HAVE time left. Not at this rate."
160. Ahdia: "Then I'd better work faster."
161. **DECISION POINT 4 CHOSEN: Set Boundary**
162. Ruth (standing up, voice shaking): "I can't watch you do this."
163. Ahdia (looking up, surprised): "Ruth—"
164. Ruth: "I can't keep providing treatment that enables you to kill yourself faster."
165. Ahdia: "You're not enabling—"
166. Ruth: "I AM. Every treatment buys you time to burn yourself out on secret missions. Every time I stabilize your cells, you go destroy them again."
167. Ahdia (standing, unsteady): "So what, you're going to let me die?"
168. Ruth: "I'm going to stop helping you die faster while calling it saving you."
169. Silence (heavy, both women facing each other)
170. Ahdia: "You're my doctor."
171. Ruth: "And you're my patient. Which means I have an ethical obligation not to enable self-harm."
172. Ahdia (anger rising): "Self-harm? I'm trying to save lives!"
173. Ruth: "By sacrificing yours! How many people have you saved this week?"
174. Ahdia (defensive): "That's not—"
175. Ruth: "How many?"

### BEATS 176-205: Resolve Check and Ahdia's Response
176. **RESOLVE CHECK:** d10=8, +7=15 vs DC 9 (SUCCESS)
177. Ruth holds the line. She means it.
178. Ahdia (after long silence): "Thirty-eight."
179. Ruth: "What?"
180. Ahdia: "Thirty-eight people this week. Journalists in Eastern Europe. Trafficking victims in Southeast Asia. Workers trapped in a factory collapse."
181. Ruth (quiet): "And you think that justifies—"
182. Ahdia: "I think they're alive because I didn't stop to worry about my baseline percentage!"
183. Ruth: "And in three days when you crash? Who saves them then?"
184. Ahdia: "Someone else will—"
185. Ruth: "No one else CAN. You're the only one with these powers. And you're burning them out."
186. Ahdia pacing (trapped, defensive): "So what's your solution? I just stop? Let people die because I need rest?"
187. Ruth: "I'm saying you can't save everyone if you're dead."
188. Ahdia (bitter laugh): "I'm dying anyway, Ruth. We both know that."
189. Ruth: "Not in three days you're not. Not if you stop."
190. Ahdia: "Stop and what? Wait for the treatment to fail anyway? Buy myself another month watching the world burn?"
191. Ruth: "Buy yourself TIME. Time to train someone else. Time to find another solution. Time to—"
192. Ahdia: "There IS no other solution. There's just me, running out of time, trying to do what I can while I still can."
193. Ruth (recognizing the pattern): "You sound like an addict."
194. Ahdia (stung): "I'm not—"
195. Ruth: "You're chasing a high. The rush of saving people. The feeling of being needed. And you're willing to die for it."
196. Ahdia: "That's not fair."
197. Ruth: "Isn't it? You're lying to everyone. Hiding your missions. Refusing to stop even when your body is screaming at you to stop. What do you call that?"
198. Ahdia (defensive walls cracking): "I call it doing what needs to be done."
199. Ruth: "And I call it suicide with extra steps."
200. Silence (Ahdia has no response to that)
201. Ruth (softer, exhausted): "I love you. You're my best friend. And I can't keep watching you do this."
202. Ahdia (quiet): "So what are you saying?"
203. Ruth: "I'm saying the next treatment is conditional."
204. Ahdia: "Conditional on what?"
205. Ruth: "On you being honest about what you're doing and why. And on you agreeing to sustainable limits."

### BEATS 206-235: Standoff
206. Ahdia staring at Ruth (disbelief): "You're serious."
207. Ruth: "Completely."
208. Ahdia: "You'd let me die to prove a point?"
209. Ruth: "I'd let you face the consequences of your choices instead of enabling them."
210. Ahdia (anger): "Easy for you to say when you're not the one with powers! When you can't hear people dying!"
211. Ruth: "You're right. I can't. But I can hear YOU dying. And I'm telling you to stop."
212. Ahdia: "I can't."
213. Ruth: "Can't or won't?"
214. Ahdia (breaking): "Both! I can't stop because people need me and I won't stop because stopping means admitting I can't fix everything!"
215. Ruth (quiet): "You can't fix everything."
216. Ahdia (tears starting): "I have to try."
217. Ruth: "Why?"
218. Ahdia: "Because if I don't, who will?"
219. Ruth: "Other people. The team. CADENS. The systems we're building."
220. Ahdia: "They're not enough."
221. Ruth: "They have to be. Because YOU'RE not enough either. No one person is."
222. Ahdia (sitting down hard, exhausted): "So what, I just... give up?"
223. Ruth (sitting beside her): "No. You choose to live long enough to build something sustainable."
224. Ahdia: "And the people who die while I'm 'being sustainable'?"
225. Ruth: "Are not your sole responsibility."
226. Ahdia: "Feels like they are."
227. Ruth: "I know. But that feeling is killing you."
228. Silence (both women exhausted, 4:30 AM)
229. Ahdia (quietly): "I can't tell you what I'm doing."
230. Ruth: "Why not?"
231. Ahdia: "Because it's bigger than saving random people. And if I tell you, you'll try to stop me."
232. Ruth: "Is it related to TRIOMF? The conspiracy?"
233. Ahdia (surprised): "You know about—"
234. Ruth: "The team connected everything yesterday. We know about Titan, the fusion reactor, the mining, the harassment campaigns. All of it."
235. Ahdia (processing): "All of it?"

### BEATS 236-270: The Revelation (Full Disclosure)
236. **DECISION POINT 5: Full Revelation**
237. Ruth: "We know about Director Bourn personally ordering the Isaiah Bennett cover-up."
238. Ahdia (face going pale): "What?"
239. Ruth: "Tess infiltrated her father's gala last night. Got the full picture. SecDef paid from Defense budget, bodycam footage altered, forensics falsified."
240. Ahdia (standing, agitated): "Tess did WHAT?"
241. Ruth: "She got proof. Complete chain of evidence. Bourn signed off on everything."
242. Ahdia pacing (crisis visible): "No. No, you don't understand—"
243. Ruth: "We understand perfectly. CADENS Director is corrupt. She covered up a murder for political favors."
244. Ahdia (sharp): "That's not—it's not that simple—"
245. Ruth: "Then explain it to me. Because right now it looks like the woman I report to is part of the conspiracy."
246. Ahdia (trapped, calculating rapidly): "You can't expose her."
247. Ruth: "Why not?"
248. Ahdia: "Because—" (stops herself)
249. Ruth: "Because why, Ahdia?"
250. Ahdia (desperate): "Because if you do, everything falls apart."
251. Ruth (connecting dots): "Your secret missions. They're about Bourn."
252. Ahdia (not confirming, not denying): "I can't talk about this."
253. Ruth: "Can't or won't?"
254. Ahdia: "Both! Ruth, if the team goes public with this, people die."
255. Ruth: "What people?"
256. Ahdia: "I can't tell you that!"
257. Ruth (standing, confronting): "Is Bourn dirty or not?"
258. Ahdia (long pause): "It's not that simple."
259. Ruth: "'Not that simple' is not an answer."
260. Ahdia: "It's the only answer I can give you."
261. Ruth: "Not good enough. Not anymore."
262. Ahdia (breaking): "She's not what you think!"
263. Ruth: "Then what is she?"
264. Ahdia: "I CAN'T TELL YOU." (shouting, then quieter) "If I tell you, her cover is blown. If her cover is blown, she can't help anymore. If she can't help, the conspiracy wins."
265. Ruth (processing): "Cover. You said cover."
266. Ahdia (realizing she revealed too much): "I didn't—"
267. Ruth: "You said 'her cover is blown.' Which means she's not actually working WITH them."
268. Ahdia (silent, trapped)
269. Ruth (pieces clicking): "She's resisting. From inside."
270. Ahdia (defeated): "I didn't say that."

### BEATS 271-300: Ruth's Realization
271. Ruth: "You didn't have to."
272. Ruth sitting down (mind racing): "The cover-up. She signed off but she didn't want to."
273. Ahdia (not confirming, not denying): "..."
274. Ruth: "Someone has leverage over her. The SecDef?"
275. Ahdia (quiet): "Please stop."
276. Ruth: "And you've been protecting her. That's what the missions are. You're running interference for a CADENS Director who's trapped."
277. Ahdia: "If the team finds out, they'll expose her. She'll be fired or arrested. And then there's no one inside CADENS resisting."
278. Ruth: "So you're killing yourself to protect one institutional ally?"
279. Ahdia: "I'm buying time for someone who's trying to do the right thing in an impossible position!"
280. Ruth: "By sacrificing yourself."
281. Ahdia: "By using what time I have to make a difference!"
282. Ruth (quiet): "Does she know what it's costing you?"
283. Ahdia: "Ryu tells her. She begs me to stop."
284. Ruth: "And you won't."
285. Ahdia: "I can't. Not yet."
286. Ruth: "When? When you're dead?"
287. Ahdia: "When the conspiracy is stopped. When Kain loses. When there's another option."
288. Ruth: "And if that doesn't happen before you collapse?"
289. Ahdia (no answer)
290. Ruth: "You're gambling that you'll survive long enough to fix everything."
291. Ahdia: "I'm gambling that I can buy enough time for someone else to fix it."
292. Ruth: "That's not a gamble. That's suicide."
293. Ahdia (sitting down, exhausted): "Maybe. But it's the only play I have."
294. Silence (4:45 AM, both women exhausted)
295. Ruth: "The team is planning to leak everything to the press. Including Bourn."
296. Ahdia (alarm): "When?"
297. Ruth: "Soon. Days, maybe. Ben has everything documented."
298. Ahdia: "You have to stop them."
299. Ruth: "How? I work for Bourn. If I defend her, I look complicit."
300. Ahdia: "Then stall them. Delay it. Give me time."

### BEATS 301-355: The Plan and Conditions
301. Ruth: "Time for what?"
302. Ahdia: "To find another way to expose the conspiracy without burning Bourn."
303. Ruth: "In three days? While you're dying?"
304. Ahdia: "I don't have a choice."
305. Ruth: "You DO. You can tell the team the truth."
306. Ahdia: "And blow her cover the day before they leak it anyway?"
307. Ruth: "Or you can let me tell them."
308. Ahdia (sharp): "No."
309. Ruth: "Why not?"
310. Ahdia: "Because they won't believe it. Because it sounds like a cover story. Because they have EVIDENCE that she's corrupt."
311. Ruth: "Evidence that she was forced to sign off on. That she left breadcrumbs in."
312. Ahdia (surprised): "How did you—"
313. Ruth: "I've been reading her reports for six months. Her forensics work on Bennett was deliberately sloppy. She WANTED someone to find the inconsistencies."
314. Ahdia: "You knew?"
315. Ruth: "I suspected. I didn't have proof. And I didn't know you were protecting her."
316. Ahdia: "Does the team suspect?"
317. Ruth: "Not openly. But I think... I think they have doubts they're not voicing."
318. Ahdia: "Then use that. Plant the seed. Make them question."
319. Ruth: "And how do I do that without revealing you're involved?"
320. Ahdia: "I don't know! I'm not a strategist, Ruth. I just save people and hope it's enough!"
321. Ruth (quiet): "It's not enough. Not this time."
322. Ahdia (tears starting): "I know."
323. Ruth: "You need help."
324. Ahdia: "I can't ask for help without revealing—"
325. Ruth: "I'm not asking permission. I'm telling you. You need help."
326. Ahdia: "From who?"
327. Ruth: "From me. From the team. From people who can strategize better than 'work until I die.'"
328. Ahdia: "They can't know about Bourn."
329. Ruth: "Then we give them part of the truth."
330. Ahdia: "What part?"
331. **DECISION POINT 6: Strategy - Ruth advocates to team**
332. Ruth: "I'll bring it up at the next team meeting. Say I have concerns about the Bennett investigation."
333. Ahdia: "They'll ask what concerns."
334. Ruth: "I'll say the forensics were sloppy. That it doesn't match Bourn's usual standards."
335. Ahdia: "And if they push back?"
336. Ruth: "I'll push harder. I'm the one who works with her directly. I have credibility here."
337. Ahdia (hopeful): "You think they'll listen?"
338. Ruth: "I think they'll at least pause. Which buys you time."
339. Ahdia: "How much time?"
340. Ruth: "A week. Maybe two if I'm persuasive."
341. Ahdia: "That's not enough—"
342. Ruth: "It's what you GET. Because you're not burning through treatments every two days anymore."
343. Ahdia (defensive): "Ruth—"
344. Ruth: "No. That's the condition. I buy you time with the team, you stop killing yourself on missions."
345. Ahdia: "I can't just stop—"
346. Ruth: "Sustainable pace. Coordinate with Ryu. Space treatments to 72 hours minimum."
347. Ahdia: "What if something urgent comes up?"
348. Ruth: "Then you call the team. That's what they're for."
349. Ahdia (frustrated): "They can't do what I do."
350. Ruth: "Then you train them better. Or you accept that some things won't get done. But you don't get to die proving you're indispensable."
351. Ahdia (long silence, then quietly): "Okay."
352. Ruth: "Okay?"
353. Ahdia: "Okay. Seventy-two hours minimum. I'll coordinate with Ryu."
354. Ruth: "And you'll stay local unless it's an actual emergency."
355. Ahdia: "Define emergency."

### BEATS 356-420: Ruth's Observation and Parting
356. Ruth: "If you have to ask, it's not an emergency."
357. Ruth standing to leave (exhausted, dawn approaching outside)
358. Ruth pausing at door: "There's something else."
359. Ahdia: "What?"
360. Ruth: "You've been burning the candle at both ends. Missions across continents, treatment every day, barely sleeping."
361. Ahdia: "I know. That's what we've been talking about—"
362. Ruth: "But Go Squad has been succeeding anyway. Even when you weren't there."
363. Ahdia (confused): "What do you mean?"
364. Ruth: "The coordinated attacks. Chapter 11. Four sites, we were spread thin, should have been a disaster."
365. Ahdia: "Ruth pulled off perfect triage. That was skill—"
366. Ruth: "It was more than skill. The odds were tilting in our favor when they shouldn't have."
367. Ahdia (uncertain): "I was there for that. I remember—"
368. Ruth: "Were you? Because you'd just come back from Eastern Europe that morning. You were exhausted."
369. Ahdia (thinking back): "I was there at the first site. Then..."
370. Ruth: "Then you were at the university. And the community center. And Riverside Park."
371. Ahdia (slowly): "No. I wasn't at all of them. I couldn't be everywhere at once."
372. Ruth: "Exactly. But someone was helping."
373. Ahdia: "What are you saying?"
374. Ruth: "I'm saying you can't be doing everything. Someone or something else is tipping the scales."
375. Ahdia (defensive): "I didn't ask for help—"
376. Ruth: "I know. But maybe you've been getting it anyway."
377. Ahdia processing (genuinely confused): "That doesn't make sense. If someone was helping, I'd know."
378. Ruth: "Would you? You were barely conscious after treatments. Running on fumes between missions."
379. Ahdia: "So what, you think someone's been... what? Time manipulating for me?"
380. Ruth: "I think you're not as alone as you think you are."
381. Ahdia: "Ruth, no one else has these powers."
382. Ruth: "That you know of."
383. Silence (Ahdia can't explain it, Ruth can't prove it)
384. Ahdia: "So what do we conclude?"
385. Ruth: "That maybe you're just that good. And maybe luck has been on our side."
386. Ahdia (not convinced but exhausted): "Luck."
387. Ruth: "Or skill. Or both. Does it matter?"
388. Ahdia: "I guess not."
389. Ruth: "The point is: You don't have to do everything. The odds are working out even when you're not actively manipulating them."
390. Ahdia: "So I should... what? Trust that luck will hold?"
391. Ruth: "Trust that you have a team. Trust that the universe isn't entirely against us. And trust that rest won't mean failure."
392. Ahdia (tired smile): "When did you become the optimist?"
393. Ruth: "When I realized you were determined to be the pessimist."
394. Ahdia: "Someone has to plan for worst-case scenarios."
395. Ruth: "And someone has to remind you that best-case scenarios exist too."
396. Ruth opening door (5:12 AM, sun starting to rise)
397. Ruth pausing: "Next treatment is in 72 hours. Not a minute sooner."
398. Ahdia: "I know."
399. Ruth: "And if you break that timeline, I pull the plug completely."
400. Ahdia: "I understand."
401. Ruth: "And Ahdia?"
402. Ahdia: "Yeah?"
403. Ruth: "Thank you for trusting me."
404. Ahdia (surprised): "I didn't have a choice."
405. Ruth: "You always have a choice. You chose to tell me about Bourn."
406. Ahdia: "You figured it out yourself—"
407. Ruth: "You could have lied better. You chose not to."
408. Ahdia (quiet): "I'm tired of lying."
409. Ruth: "I know. Get some sleep."
410. Ruth leaving (door closing behind her)
411. Ahdia alone in penthouse (dawn light through windows)
412. Ahdia looking at her hands (still trembling from treatment)
413. Ahdia thinking: Who was helping at the sites?
414. Ahdia replaying memories: She was at first site, then... where?
415. Gaps in her memory (exhaustion? Treatment side effects?)
416. Ahdia: "Luck. Right."
417. Ahdia not believing it (but no other explanation)
418. Ahdia moving to recovery room (needs sleep)
419. Last thought before sleep: Someone's watching. Someone's helping.
420. **CHAPTER END**

## Integration Notes

### Connects to Chapter 16
- Team concluded Bourn is corrupt after Tess's infiltration
- Evidence compiled and ready to leak
- Ruth's position compromised (working for "corrupt" director)
- Ahdia was absent from emergency meeting, locked team out of HQ

### Sets Up Chapter 18
- Ruth must convince team to delay leak at next meeting
- Ahdia has 72-hour treatment timeline (test of sustainable pace)
- Bourn's resistance still secret (Ruth can't reveal coordination)
- Mystery of "who helped" planted for later reveal

### Prime Mystery Setup
- Ruth observes successes when Ahdia wasn't present (Chapter 11 callbacks)
- Both Ahdia and Ruth can't explain it
- Conclude it's luck/skill (Both/And: True AND Prime helping)
- Reader knows something is off, doesn't know what yet
- Pays off in Month 11 (Prime reveals herself on election night)

### Medical Timeline Established
- Ahdia at 54% baseline (critical level)
- Agreed to 72-hour minimum between treatments
- Three treatments remaining from Ryu
- Timeline: Best case 9 days, worst case 3 days
- Month 6 → approaching Month 7 crisis

### Bourn Conspiracy Layer
- Four-layer structure now clear:
  - Layer 1: TRIOMF (tactical ops)
  - Layer 2: SecDef leverage (institutional control)
  - Layer 3: Bourn resistance (hidden ally)
  - Layer 4: Eidolon (supernatural amplification)
- Ruth will advocate without revealing Layer 3
- Team doesn't know Bourn is resisting
- Dramatic irony heightened
