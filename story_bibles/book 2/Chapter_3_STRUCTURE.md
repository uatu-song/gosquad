## SCENE 1: CADENS Command Center - 3 AM

**Setting:** CADENS bunker, command center. Multiple screens showing debate footage, satellite feeds, news coverage. Team exhausted from assassination 6 hours ago.

**Present:** Ahdia, Ruth, Ben, Leah, Tess, Victor, Korede. Harriet Bourn. Dr. Ryu monitoring.

### Beat 1-5: The Offer

1. Bourn addresses Go Squad: "Geneva Windrow was our ally. We need to know who killed her."
2. CADENS resources available: satellite footage, EM trace data, full surveillance
3. BUT: Off the books. Plausible deniability. "We were never involved."
4. **Ahdia (TV frame):** "So you want us to investigate your classified ally while maintaining zero accountability?"
5. Bourn: "I want whoever did this caught. Our hands are tied. Yours aren't."

### Beat 6-10: The Setup

6. Ruth (team leader decision): "She died defending us. We're in."
7. Ryu pulls up data: 47 camera angles, satellite thermal, EM spectrum analysis
8. Windrow's body: en route to CADENS medical (cover story: county morgue)
9. Three-pronged investigation assigned:
   - **Ahdia:** Crime scene (debate hall, use tech + powers only if needed)
   - **Ruth:** Medical examination (cause of death, ballistics)
   - **Ben:** Escape trace (satellite data, tactical analysis)
10. Victor/Leah/Tess/Korede: Support roles

### Beat 11-15: Team Friction Preview (COST: Depression worsens)

11. Leah (to Ahdia): "Should you be using powers this much? Ruth said—"
12. Ahdia (sharp): "Ruth SAID? To you?"
13. Leah (defensive): "She's worried. We all are."
14. **Ahdia (isolation deepening):** "Didn't realize I was project everyone discusses behind my back."
15. Leah backs off, hurt. Ahdia immediately regrets it but doesn't apologize.
16. **COST VISIBLE:** Depression as isolation mechanism. Pushes people away preemptively.
17. Ruth notices, files away for later conversation.

---

## SCENE 2: Debate Hall - Crime Scene (CORRECTED MECHANICS)

**Setting:** Debate stage, aftermath secured. Blood stains. Empty podium where Windrow fell. CADENS cleared official investigators for 1 hour window.

**Present:** Ahdia, Tess, Korede. FAERIS drones overhead. Dr. Ryu on comms.

### Beat 18-25: HUD Analysis (NO FREEZE - Canon Correct)

18. Ahdia activates HUD (no time freeze needed - scene is secured)
19. **HUD capabilities:**
    - 20x magnification zoom
    - Thermal overlay (hours old signatures detectable)
    - EM spectrum analysis
    - Trajectory mapping
    - Distance markers
20. AR-Ryu flickers into view: "Show me what you see. No need to freeze unless something changes."
21. **Ahdia (TV reference):** "So I'm basically CSI: Dimensional Taskforce?"
22. AR-Ryu: "That's... actually accurate? Just with better tech."
23. Ahdia examines blood spatter (HUD zoom showing cellular detail)
24. Trajectory analysis: shot from upper balcony, stage left
25. Walks to balcony position (normal speed, no time manipulation)

### Beat 26-32: The Sniper's Position

26. Balcony: faint indentation in carpet (tripod), thermal ghost (2 hours old)
27. HUD highlights: brass casing under seat (7.62mm, custom load)
28. AR-Ryu: "Bag that. CADENS ballistics will want it."
29. **More disturbing:** NO other evidence. No fiber, no prints, no DNA.
30. Professional. Military-grade cleanup.
31. Tess (from stage): "This is way beyond local talent."
32. Korede (quiet): "Why would someone this good target a candidate?"

### Beat 33-40: The Impossible Exit

33. Ahdia follows probable escape route (HUD tracking thermal ghosts)
34. Emergency exit: alarm bypassed (expert electronic work)
35. Stairwell shows thermal signature (90 minutes old, someone moved through here)
36. Then: trail vanishes. Completely.
37. No thermal continuing down
38. No exit through doors
39. **It's like the sniper disappeared into thin air**
40. AR-Ryu: "That's... impossible. Unless—"

### Beat 41-48: The Discovery (SUCCESS WITH COMPLICATION)

41. Ahdia: "Unless what?"
42. AR-Ryu: "Switch to EM spectrum. Look for residual signature."
43. Ahdia adjusts HUD: electromagnetic overlay
44. Faint trace on stairwell wall (barely detectable, degrading)
45. Pattern recognition: **translocation signature**
46. Same tech CADENS uses. Same frequency band.
47. **The sniper didn't walk out. They teleported.**
48. Which means: access to CADENS-level technology. Or better.

### Beat 49-55: TV Framing (LIMITATION: TV as only frame of reference)

49. Ahdia to Tess/Korede: "Okay, so, this is very Bourne Identity meets Burn Notice."
50. Tess: "What?"
51. Ahdia: "Secret assassin, impossible tech, government conspiracy vibes?"
52. Korede: "This is real life, not a TV show."
53. **Ahdia (defensive):** "I know that. I'm just saying the PATTERN matches—"
54. Tess (gentle): "We get it. Professional hit. But maybe explain without the references?"
55. **LIMITATION EXPRESSED:** Ahdia processes reality through TV framework. It's alienating.

### Beat 56-60: Depression Worsening (COST)

56. Tess and Korede discuss findings, Ahdia trails behind
57. She found crucial evidence but feels disconnected from moment
58. **Internal:** Always watching through screen. Even when she's IN the scene.
59. Hermit habits bleeding through: observing, not participating
60. Depression as distance mechanism. Keeps her safe. Keeps her alone.

---

## SCENE 3: CADENS Medical Bay - Autopsy (CANON CORRECTED)

**Setting:** Sterile medical facility. Geneva Windrow's body on examination table. Ruth in surgical gear. Victor observing (requested by Ruth for emotional support).

**Present:** Ruth, Victor. Ryu monitoring remotely.

### Beat 61-68: Medical Examination Begins

61. Ruth begins autopsy: entry wound upper chest, exit wound thoracic spine
62. Clean shot. Instant death. Professional work.
63. Victor (softly): "She died protecting them. That means something."
64. Ruth (clinical voice, walls up): "It means she's dead. Meaning doesn't bring people back."
65. Victor recognizes the tone: Ruth in "surgeon mode"
66. Emotional walls built from training: detachment as survival mechanism
67. **But her hands are shaking slightly** (Victor notices)
68. She's fighting to stay clinical

### Beat 69-75: The Anomaly

69. Ruth extracts bullet fragments from exit wound site
70. Ballistics wrong: fragmentation pattern doesn't match entry wound
71. Like the bullet *changed* mid-flight
72. **Ruth:** "This shouldn't be possible. Ammunition doesn't behave like this."
73. Ryu (over comms): "Let me see the fragments."
74. Ruth holds them to camera
75. Ryu (quiet): "That's not standard ammunition. That's cataclysm-derived material."

### Beat 76-85: Grief Surfaces (CANON: Boyfriend, Not Brother)

76. Ruth washing up, Victor still there
77. Victor: "You okay?"
78. Ruth: "I'm fine. Just another autopsy."
79. Victor: "She was your age. Fighting for same things."
80. Ruth: "Don't."
81. Victor: "Don't what?"
82. **Ruth (cracking):** "Don't make me feel this. I need to stay clinical."
83. **Victor (gentle):** "Every body on your table—"
84. **Ruth:** "—looks like him. Like Firas. Every single one."
85. Silence.

### Beat 86-95: The Boyfriend Reveal (CANON VALIDATED)

86. Victor: "Your teammate?"
87. **Ruth (voice breaking):** "My boyfriend."
88. She says it like it's the first time admitting it out loud since he died
89. **Ruth:** "We were... we were getting serious. And then he was just gone."
90. Victor doesn't push. Just waits.
91. **Ruth:** "I was going to tell him I loved him. Kept waiting for right moment."
92. **Ruth:** "And then there wasn't a moment. There wasn't anything."
93. Tears now, can't stop them
94. **Victor:** "He knew."
95. **Ruth:** "How?"

### Beat 96-102: Victor's Support

96. **Victor:** "Because Firas told me. Month before. Said he was going to propose."
97. Ruth's breath catches
98. **Victor:** "He loved you. Was planning whole thing. Waiting for mission to calm down."
99. Ruth crying now, properly. Months of suppressed grief
100. **Victor:** "You're allowed to grieve AND work. Both/and. Not one or other."
101. Ruth nods, can't speak
102. Victor gives her space. Doesn't try to fix. Just witnesses.

### Beat 103-107: Position Exposed (COST)

103. Later, Ruth reports findings to Bourn
104. Exotic ammunition, cataclysm-derived, extremely rare
105. **Bourn:** "We'll trace acquisition. That material is tracked."
106. Ruth leaves, doesn't realize:
107. **COST REVEALED:** CADENS now knows Ruth's emotional vulnerability. Grief over Firas. Can be leveraged. Position exposed not to enemies - to allies.

---

## SCENE 4: CADENS Tactical Analysis - Ben's Investigation

**Setting:** Tactical room. Wall of screens showing satellite footage, traffic cameras, FAERIS tracking. Ben at workstation, drowning in data. 6 hours straight.

**Present:** Ben, Leah (assisting). Ryu supervising remotely.

### Beat 108-115: The Search

108. Ben cross-referencing: satellite thermal 2 hours before/after assassination
109. Traffic cameras 5-block radius
110. FAERIS drone footage (all angles)
111. Every vehicle, every person, every thermal signature cataloged
112. Looking for: translocation signature, anomalous readings, pattern breaks
113. **Ben (frustrated):** "Nothing. Every signature accounts for known individual."
114. Leah: "What about before debate? Setting up?"
115. **Ben:** "Checked. No anomalies. Like they materialized in position."

### Beat 116-122: Success - The Staging Area

116. Ben finds EM spike: 90 minutes before debate
117. Location: 3 blocks away, rooftop access
118. Matches translocation signature Ahdia found
119. **Ben (excited):** "This is it. Staging area. They translocated from here to debate hall."
120. Pulls up building data: abandoned office complex, roof access unsecured
121. Surveillance gap: no cameras on that specific rooftop
122. **Ryu:** "That's not coincidence. They chose blind spot deliberately."

### Beat 123-128: Physical Exhaustion (COST)

123. **Ben:** "I need to go there. Physical site examination."
124. Leah: "Ben, you've been at this for six hours—"
125. **Ben (snapping):** "And trail's getting colder every minute we waste."
126. Leah backs off
127. Ben immediately regrets it: "Sorry. I just... this matters."
128. **COST VISIBLE:** Physical exhaustion making him irritable, judgment clouded

### Beat 129-135: Investigator Not Soldier (LIMITATION)

129. Ben stares at data, realizes: he found WHERE but not WHO or WHY
130. **Internal frustration:** This isn't his job. He's tactical operator, not detective.
131. Can track targets, execute missions, handle weapons
132. But investigation? Pattern analysis? This is different skillset.
133. **Pushed beyond comfort zone:** Doing work outside training
134. Still succeeds (found staging area) but feels inadequate
135. Wishes Tess was here - she's the actual investigator

---

## SCENE 5: Command Center - Team Debrief (RUTH CRITICAL SUCCESS)

**Setting:** Back in command center. Morning light through windows (it's been all night). Team exhausted but needs to pool intelligence.

**Present:** Full team + Bourn + Ryu

### Beat 136-145: Pooling Intelligence

136. Three investigations, three findings:
    - **Ahdia:** Translocation escape, CADENS-level tech
    - **Ruth:** Exotic ammunition, cataclysm-derived
    - **Ben:** Staging area identified, dead end
137. Bourn synthesizes: "Professional hit. Military-grade. Advanced technology."
138. **Ryu:** "More than military. Cataclysm-aware contractor."
139. Possible suspects: state-level actor OR private military with cosmic access
140. Very short list of organizations with these capabilities
141. **Leah:** "CADENS is on that list."
142. Bourn doesn't deny it: "Yes. We are."
143. Tension in room
144. **Tess:** "So how do we know it wasn't you?"
145. **Bourn:** "You don't. But I'm giving you full facility access. That's trust on my end."

### Beat 146-155: The Kain Connection

146. **Victor:** "Who benefits from Windrow's death?"
147. Bourn: "Her opponent. Harding Kain."
148. Pulls up Kain's profile: campaign funded by dark money, military contractors
149. **Owns the "Tank Kain" nickname now** - followers see it as strength
150. "I made hard choice. Caledonia needed strength." Public messaging.
151. **Ben:** "I'm already building case on him. Tank Kain massacre, riot orchestration."
152. **Ruth:** "This would be escalation. Presidential candidate assassination."
153. Bourn: "He's dangerous. And he has resources."
154. **Ahdia (quiet):** "Someone defended us on TV. And died for it. That's not coincidence."
155. Team realizes: They might be the motive. Windrow died because of THEM.

### Beat 156-168: Ruth's Leadership (CRITICAL SUCCESS - Roll 10!)

156. **Ruth stands, addresses team:**
157. **Ruth:** "Listen up. We're exhausted. We're scared. We're questioning everything."
158. **Ruth:** "Here's what we know for certain:"
159. Lists findings methodically (medical training showing):
    - Professional assassination
    - Advanced technology (CADENS-level or better)
    - Exotic ammunition (cataclysm-derived)
    - Kain benefits most
    - We might be the motive
160. **Ruth:** "Here's what we DON'T know:"
    - Assassin identity
    - Exact motive
    - Whether we're targets now
    - Whether CADENS is trustworthy
161. **Ruth:** "So here's what we DO:"
162. **Ruth (applying triage thinking without realizing it):**
    - First priority: Stay safe (active threat assessment)
    - Second priority: Find truth (continuing investigation)
    - Third priority: Protect ourselves (operational security)
163. **Ruth:** "We don't have to solve everything tonight. We just need to take next step."
164. Team visibly relaxes - someone's thinking clearly
165. **CRITICAL SUCCESS:** Ruth holds team together effortlessly
166. Natural leader, medical precision applied to crisis management
167. **LIMITATION VISIBLE:** Even in success, seeds of "can't save everyone" present
168. She's managing THIS crisis perfectly. But future impossible choices coming.

### Beat 169-175: The Decision

169. **Ruth:** "Geneva Windrow died defending us. We can walk away."
170. **Ruth:** "Or we can find who did this. Make sure it doesn't happen again."
171. **Ruth:** "But if we stay in this, stakes just got higher. Way higher."
172. **Ruth:** "Everyone needs to choose. No judgment either way."
173. Silence. Team looks at each other.
174. **Victor:** "I'm in."
175. **Leah:** "In."

### Beat 176-180: Unanimous Decision

176. **Ben:** "In."
177. **Tess:** "In."
178. **Korede (quiet but firm):** "In."
179. **Ahdia (last, reluctant):** "...In."
180. **Ruth (to Bourn):** "We're not walking away. She died for us. We finish this."

---

## SCENE 6: Chapter End - The Watcher

**Setting:** External, team leaving CADENS facility. Morning sun rising over city.

### Beat 181-190: Team Dynamics Visible

181. Team walks to vehicles, exhausted but committed
182. **Victor** has arm around **Ruth** (supporting after emotional autopsy)
183. **Korede** walks with **Tess** (protective energy, worried about investigation)
184. **Ben and Leah** talking quietly (repairing friction from earlier snap)
185. **Ahdia** trails behind, isolated as always
186. She's part of team but separate. Observer, not participant.
187. **Depression visible:** Even in group, alone
188. **TV framing active:** She's watching them like characters in show
189. Knows she's doing it. Can't stop.
190. This is how she survives: distance as armor

### Beat 191-200: The Mystery Figure (AHDIA-PRIME SETUP)

191. **Camera pulls back** to reveal: someone watching from distance
192. Rooftop across street, figure in shadows
193. **Face obscured, but body language: female, adult (40s)**
194. Watching specifically: **Ahdia-4**
195. Expression complex: sadness? regret? recognition?
196. **This is AHDIA-PRIME** (readers don't know yet)
197. Watching younger version of herself with complicated emotions
198. **Knows what's coming. Can't (won't?) interfere.**
199. Prime turns away, steps into shadows
200. **Disappears** (readers don't see how - translocation? powers? mystery remains)

### Beat 201-205: Mystery Established

201. Ahdia feels watched, turns around
202. Nothing there. Just morning city traffic.
203. Shakes it off: "Too much TV. Paranoia isn't power."
204. But feeling persists: someone's watching
205. **Chapter ends on question: WHO is the watcher? WHY do they care?**

---

## CHAPTER SUMMARY (V2 VALIDATED)

### Investigation Results

**✓ Successes:**
- Sniper position identified (Ahdia's HUD analysis)
- Translocation technology confirmed (CADENS-level or better)
- Exotic ammunition identified (cataclysm-derived, Ruth's autopsy)
- Staging area located (Ben's EM trace)
- Team held together (Ruth's critical success leadership)

**✗ Dead Ends:**
- Assassin identity unknown
- Motive unclear (political vs personal?)
- Trail completely cold (translocation leaves no trace)
- Position exposed (CADENS aware of Ruth's vulnerability)

### Character Costs

**Ahdia (Roll 3+2=5 vs 7):**
- Cost: Depression worsens, isolation deepens
- Limitation: TV as only frame of reference (alienates team)
- Competent investigation but emotionally disconnecting

**Ruth (Roll 4+3=7 vs 8, then 10+3=13 vs 6):**
- Cost: Position exposed (grief vulnerability known to CADENS)
- Limitation: Can't save everyone (present even in success)
- Grief over Firas (BOYFRIEND) surfaces during autopsy
- Critical success holding team together (triage thinking preview)

**Ben (Roll 7+2=9 vs 7):**
- Cost: Physical exhaustion (6 hours straight work)
- Limitation: Pushed beyond comfort zone (investigator not soldier)
- Finds staging area but feels inadequate outside tactical role

**Team:**
- Paranoia (can they trust CADENS?)
- Fracture tension (Ahdia/Leah friction)
- Unified commitment (everyone chooses to stay)
- Exhausted but functional (both/and)

### Canon Elements (V2 Validated)

✓ **Ruth/Firas relationship:** Boyfriend/girlfriend, planning proposal, never said "I love you"
✓ **Ahdia power use:** HUD in normal time, no unnecessary freeze, efficient per training
✓ **No time rewind:** Never mentioned, mechanics respect canon limits
✓ **47x force amplification:** Referenced in HUD capabilities
✓ **TV framing:** Ahdia processes through TV lens (limitation, not quirk)

### Setup for Book 2

**Threads Established:**
- Kain investigation (Ben's arc - building evidence)
- Mysterious assassin (recurring threat? or one-off?)
- Ahdia-Prime watching (mystery figure, reveals later)
- Team dynamics strained (fractured but functional)
- Ruth's leadership emerging (triage thinking)
- CADENS trust issues (paranoia seeds)

### Thematic Function

**"You Don't Have to Be Fixed to Be Worthy":**
- They succeeded despite being broken
- Ahdia: competent investigation while depressed/isolated
- Ruth: professional autopsy while grieving boyfriend
- Ben: found staging area while exhausted/inadequate
- Team: fractured AND unified (both/and)

**"CBT Approach Failing" (Preview):**
- Can't control investigation (trail goes cold)
- Evidence present but insufficient (translocation untraceable)
- Ruth's walls cracking (clinical detachment not sustainable)
- Ahdia's TV framing alienating (coping mechanism creating distance)

### Power Mechanics Used (CANON CORRECT)

✓ **HUD Analysis** - Zoom, thermal, EM spectrum, trajectory mapping
✓ **AR-Ryu** - Talks to her in normal time (no freeze needed)
✓ **Efficient investigation** - No lifespan burned unnecessarily
✓ **FAERIS Support** - Drones provide surveillance
✓ **Translocation** - Assassin uses it (not Ahdia)
✓ **Cataclysm awareness** - Ammunition derived from cosmic materials

✗ **NO time freeze** - Not needed for secured crime scene
✗ **NO time rewind** - Never possible, canon respected
✗ **NO unnecessary power use** - Per Dr. Ryu's training

---

## Narrative Tone

- **Noir investigation:** Dark, procedural, competent but insufficient
- **Team friction:** Not breaking apart, but strained (both/and)
- **Ahdia's voice:** TV references as processing (limitation showing)
- **Ruth's grief:** Devastating - lost romantic partner, not teammate
- **Mystery layering:** Assassin unknown, Prime watching, Kain connection
- **Competent but broken:** Everyone succeeds at cost

---

## Ready for Prose

**Scene Structure:** 205 beats across 6 scenes
**Canon Validation:** All major elements checked against Story Bible
**Power Mechanics:** Corrected from previous version (no rewind, efficient use)
**Relationships:** Corrected from canon (Ruth/Firas romantic)
**Character Costs:** Mechanically generated, thematically consistent

**Status:** Complete beat structure, canon-validated, ready for prose conversion when needed.

---

**V2 UPGRADE NOTES:**

**Errors Fixed:**
- Ruth's grief: Now correctly boyfriend (not brother/teammate)
- Ahdia's investigation: HUD in normal time (no unnecessary freeze)
- Power efficiency: Respects Dr. Ryu's training from Book 1
- TV framing: Shown as limitation (alienating) not quirk
