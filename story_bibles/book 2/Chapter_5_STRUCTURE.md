# CHAPTER 5: Where is Ahdia? (First Eidolon Appearance)

**Month:** 1 (late Month 1, showing Ahdia's first absence)
**POV:** Go Squad (Ruth leading, Ahdia notably absent)
**Central Question:** Where is Ahdia when the team needs her?
**Eidolon Introduction:** Fear manipulation shown through civilian behavior shift

---

## SCENE 1: Pre-Patrol Briefing - CADENS Command

**Setting:** CADENS command center, evening. Go Squad prepping for routine patrol. Ahdia's absence noted.

**Present:** Ruth, Ben, Victor, Tess, Leah, Korede. Ahdia NOT present.

### Beat 1-10: Ahdia's Absence Established

1. Ruth reviewing patrol route on holo-map: downtown Caledonia, 6-block radius
2. Team suiting up, checking gear, FAERIS drones activating
3. **Victor:** "Is Ahdia meeting us there, or...?"
4. Ruth checks comm: "She said she'd catch up. Treatment ran long."
5. **Subtext:** Treatment excuse becoming frequent
6. **Tess (quiet to Korede):** "That's the third time this week."
7. Korede shrugs: Doesn't know Ahdia well enough to judge
8. **Ben:** "We've done patrols without her before. FAERIS still functional."
9. Ruth nods, but something feels off
10. **FORESHADOWING:** Ahdia's absence becoming pattern, team noticing but rationalizing

### Beat 11-18: Mission Parameters

11. Ruth briefs patrol objective: Community presence after Geneva assassination
12. Public nervous about enhanced individuals, need to show they're safe
13. **Leah:** "Are we though? Safe?"
14. **Victor:** "We're on their side. That's what matters."
15. **Tess:** "Tell that to the news coverage. We're 'dangerous vigilantes' this week."
16. **Ruth:** "Which is why we're doing this. Show up, be visible, be helpful."
17. **Ben:** "No confrontations. No power displays. Just presence."
18. Team agrees: Low-key patrol, community reassurance

### Beat 19-25: FAERIS Check (Evolving Independence)

19. Ryu over comms: "FAERIS diagnostics complete. All drones operational."
20. **Ruth:** "Even without Ahdia directing them?"
21. **Ryu (careful):** "They've been developing autonomous support patterns. Should maintain effectiveness."
22. **CANON CALLBACK:** Book 1 established FAERIS evolving (10%, growing to 50% in 6 months)
23. Team doesn't realize: Drones working independently, not because Ahdia's directing remotely
24. **Victor:** "So we're good to go?"
25. **Ruth:** "We're good. Let's move out."

---

## SCENE 2: Downtown Caledonia - Patrol Begins

**Setting:** Evening, city streets. Pedestrian traffic, normal city energy. Go Squad visible in their gear (not costumes, tactical equipment).

**Present:** Full Go Squad minus Ahdia. FAERIS drones overhead.

### Beat 26-35: Initial Civilian Interactions (Normal)

26. Go Squad walking patrol route, FAERIS providing overwatch
27. First few blocks: normal interactions
28. **Civilian 1:** "Hey, you're the Go Squad! Geneva supporter, right?"
29. **Victor:** "Yeah. We're just here making sure everyone's safe."
30. **Civilian 1:** "Good. We need you guys. Kain's people are scary."
31. Wave, fist bump, supportive energy
32. **Civilian 2 (taking photo):** "Can I post this? My friends won't believe I saw you."
33. **Tess:** "Go ahead. Tag us. Let people know we're around."
34. Positive interactions, community connection feeling real
35. **Ruth (to team, comms):** "This is good. This is what we need."

### Beat 36-48: The Shift (Eidolon's First Appearance)

36. Cross into next block, atmospheric change
37. Pedestrian traffic thins, people avoiding eye contact
38. **Leah (noticing):** "Is it just me, or did the vibe just...change?"
39. **Ben (scanning):** "No hostile signatures. No threats detected."
40. But people ARE crossing street to avoid them
41. **FAERIS alert:** EM anomaly detected, localized, faint signature
42. **Ruth:** "Ryu, are you seeing this?"
43. **Ryu (over comms):** "Confirmed. Unknown energy pattern. Not cataclysm-derived, but... unusual."
44. Pattern subtle, easy to miss, affecting area around Go Squad
45. **Victor:** "What IS that? People are acting like we're contagious."
46. **EM signature analysis:** Fear response amplification in 50-meter radius
47. **THIS IS EIDOLON** (team doesn't know yet, readers start to suspect)
48. First clear evidence: Fear manipulation entity is ACTIVE

### Beat 49-60: The Book 1 Callback - Selfie Civilian Now Fearful

49. Go Squad approaches corner, familiar face ahead
50. **Young woman (22-25), phone in hand** - SAME civilian from Book 1 who wanted selfie
51. Book 1: She was excited, starstruck, asked for photo with "real heroes"
52. Now: She sees them, freezes
53. **Victor (recognizing her):** "Hey! You're the one who wanted the selfie last month, right?"
54. She backs away, fear visible in posture
55. **Victor:** "It's okay, we're just—"
56. **Selfie Civilian (scared):** "Stay away from me."
57. **Victor (confused):** "What? We met before. You were excited—"
58. **Selfie Civilian:** "That was before. Before Geneva died. Before... just stay back!"
59. Turns, hurries away, nearly running
60. **Team stunned:** Same person, completely different reaction

### Beat 61-70: Fear Spreading

61. **Tess:** "What the hell just happened?"
62. **Ben:** "EM signature spiked when she saw us. Ryu, confirm?"
63. **Ryu:** "Confirmed. Pattern intensified during interaction. Affecting emotional response."
64. **Leah:** "You're saying something's making people afraid of us?"
65. **Ruth:** "Not making them afraid. *Amplifying* existing fear."
66. **Victor:** "But she wasn't afraid of us last month. She wanted a photo!"
67. **Ruth:** "Last month, Geneva was alive. Media wasn't calling us dangerous."
68. **Ruth:** "This thing—whatever it is—takes existing fear and cranks it to eleven."
69. More pedestrians noticing Go Squad, fear responses visible
70. **Korede:** "We should leave. We're making it worse."

### Beat 71-80: Ruth's Decision (Stay or Go)

71. **Ben:** "EM signature moving. Following us, not stationary."
72. **Victor:** "Something's targeting us specifically?"
73. **Ruth (tactical decision):** "If we leave, fear wins. We're supposed to be community presence."
74. **Tess:** "Community presence doesn't work if community's terrified of us."
75. **Ruth:** "Then we prove we're not a threat. Slow movements, no aggressive postures, help if needed."
76. **Leah (uncomfortable):** "Ruth, they look at us like we're about to attack them."
77. **Ruth:** "Which is exactly why we stay. Show we're NOT what they're afraid of."
78. **Ben:** "This is tactically unsound. Unknown entity manipulating civilians against us."
79. **Ruth (team leader voice):** "We're not running from scared people. We help scared people."
80. Team reluctantly agrees: Stay on patrol, de-escalate, observe

---

## SCENE 3: Escalation - Flash Lynch Mob Forms

**Setting:** Same patrol route, 10 minutes later. Fear has spread. Crowd forming.

**Present:** Go Squad (still no Ahdia). FAERIS overhead. Growing civilian crowd.

### Beat 81-92: Crowd Gathers (Eidolon Amplification)

81. Patrol continues, more civilians noticing Go Squad
82. **EM signature intensifying:** Fear amplification increasing
83. Whispers spreading through pedestrians
84. **Civilian 3 (to crowd):** "They're here. The ones Geneva defended before she died."
85. **Civilian 4:** "She died BECAUSE of them. They brought this on us."
86. **Civilian 5:** "Dangerous freaks. Shouldn't be allowed in our neighborhood."
87. Crowd forming, 20-30 people, fear turning to anger
88. **EIDOLON'S MECHANISM:** Justified fear (enhanced individuals ARE dangerous) → Distorted (Go Squad specifically wants to harm them)
89. **Tess:** "Ruth, we need to move. Now."
90. **Ruth:** "Slowly. No sudden movements. We're not a threat."
91. Crowd growing, blocking patrol route, aggressive postures
92. **Victor (recognizing the pattern):** "This is a mob. This is a lynch mob forming."

### Beat 93-105: The Mob Attacks (Go Squad Can't Fight Back)

93. **Civilian 6 (yelling):** "Get out of our neighborhood!"
94. First object thrown: bottle, shatters near Ben's feet
95. **Ben (comm to team):** "We don't engage. Defensive only."
96. More objects: rocks, cans, trash
97. **Leah (hit by something):** "They're actually attacking us!"
98. **Ruth:** "Shields up. FAERIS, defensive perimeter only."
99. FAERIS drones form barrier, deflecting projectiles (no offensive action)
100. **Victor:** "We can't fight civilians. That's exactly what this WANTS."
101. **Ruth:** "Whoever's doing this wants us to prove we're dangerous."
102. **Tess:** "Well they're doing a GREAT job, because I feel pretty fucking dangerous right now!"
103. Mob pressing closer, fear-fueled rage, no reasoning possible
104. **THE TRAP:** Fight back = prove you're dangerous. Don't fight = get hurt. No good option.
105. **Where the hell is Ahdia?**

### Beat 106-118: Attempting De-escalation (Failing)

106. **Ruth (loudspeaker):** "We're not here to hurt anyone! We're just patrolling!"
107. Crowd doesn't listen, EM signature drowning out reason
108. **Civilian 7:** "Liar! Geneva died because of you!"
109. **Victor (trying):** "Geneva was our ALLY! We didn't kill her!"
110. **Mob response:** "Then who did? You brought this on us!"
111. **Leah (to Ruth, panicking):** "They're not hearing us. This isn't working!"
112. **Ben (scanning):** "EM signature at 200% baseline. Fear response completely irrational now."
113. Someone grabs Korede's arm, trying to pull him from formation
114. **Tess (protective):** "GET OFF HIM!"
115. Pulls Korede back, shoves civilian (defensive, not aggressive)
116. **Mob erupts:** "SEE! THEY'RE VIOLENT!"
117. **Eidolon's amplification perfect:** Turn defense into proof of danger
118. **Ruth realizes:** They can't win this. Any action proves mob right.

### Beat 119-130: Tactical Retreat (Without Ahdia's Help)

119. **Ruth (decisive):** "Fall back. Now. FAERIS, cover retreat."
120. Team begins withdrawing, mob pressing forward
121. **Ben:** "If Ahdia were here, she could freeze them. Get us out clean."
122. **Victor:** "Well she's NOT here. We work with what we have."
123. FAERIS drones forming protective screen, not attacking, just blocking
124. **Civilian projectiles getting more dangerous:** Metal, glass, someone has a pipe
125. **Leah (hit, cut on forehead):** "I'm bleeding—"
126. **Ruth:** "Keep moving. Don't stop."
127. **Tess (furious):** "We're RUNNING from civilians?!"
128. **Ruth:** "We're RETREATING from a manipulated mob. There's a difference."
129. Alley ahead, narrow escape route
130. **Ruth (comms):** "Ryu, we need extraction. Translocation to CADENS."

### Beat 131-140: Emergency Extraction (Cost of Ahdia's Absence)

131. **Ryu:** "Coordinates locked. Translocation in 30 seconds."
132. **Mob closing in, 30 seconds feels like eternity**
133. **Korede (frightened):** "They're going to kill us—"
134. **Victor:** "No. They're scared. Being MADE scared. Not their fault."
135. **Ben (defensive formation):** "10 seconds. Hold position."
136. Mob reaches alley entrance, first person swings pipe at Ben
137. **Ben blocks (defensive), doesn't strike back**
138. **Cost visible:** Bruises, cuts, minor injuries, but didn't fight civilians
139. **Translocation activates:** Blue flash, team disappears
140. **Mob left standing in alley, confused, EM signature fading**

---

## SCENE 4: CADENS Medical Bay - Aftermath

**Setting:** Medical bay, team being treated for minor injuries. Exhausted, shaken, angry.

**Present:** Go Squad (still no Ahdia). Ruth, Ryu, Bourn present.

### Beat 141-152: Processing the Attack

141. Team in medical bay: Leah's forehead stitched, Ben's ribs bruised, others scraped/cut
142. **Tess (furious):** "We got attacked by CIVILIANS. Regular people with rocks and bottles."
143. **Leah (shaking):** "They wanted to kill us. I saw it in their eyes."
144. **Victor:** "They were terrified. Something made them terrified of us."
145. **Ryu reviewing data:** "EM signature confirmed: Fear response amplification."
146. **Bourn (entering):** "Not just amplification. Targeted emotional manipulation."
147. Team looks up: Bourn has intel
148. **Bourn:** "We've been tracking similar patterns. Different cities, always targeting enhanced individuals."
149. **Ruth:** "Someone's making people afraid of us specifically?"
150. **Bourn:** "Someone's making people's existing fears UNBEARABLE."
151. **Ben:** "Who? What are we dealing with?"
152. **Bourn:** "We don't know yet. But it's organized, intelligent, and escalating."

### Beat 153-165: The Eidolon Name Introduced

153. **Ryu:** "Energy signature doesn't match known cataclysm artifacts."
154. **Ryu:** "But the PATTERN matches something from Conclave archives."
155. **Bourn:** "Fear manipulation entities. Rare, extremely dangerous."
156. **Ruth:** "Entities? As in... alive?"
157. **Bourn:** "Sentient. Feeds on fear, amplifies fear, creates feedback loops."
158. **Tess:** "So a fear monster. Great. Just what we needed."
159. **Bourn:** "Conclave designation: Eidolon. Fear-class entity."
160. **Leah:** "Eidolon? Like... a ghost of fear?"
161. **Victor:** "Greek: An idealized phantom. Something that haunts based on perception."
162. **Ruth:** "How do we fight something that makes people afraid of us?"
163. **Bourn:** "That's the problem. Traditional tactics won't work."
164. **Ben:** "Every action we take, it'll twist into proof we're dangerous."
165. **Bourn:** "Exactly. You're in an impossible situation."

### Beat 166-178: Where is Ahdia?

166. **Ruth (exhausted):** "We need everyone on this. Full team assessment."
167. **Tess:** "Where IS Ahdia, anyway? We could've used her out there."
168. **Ruth:** "Treatment. She'll be back soon."
169. **Victor (skeptical):** "Treatment's been taking longer lately. You notice that?"
170. **Ruth (defensive):** "Cellular degradation varies. Sometimes it takes time."
171. **Leah:** "But we could have REALLY used her. Time freeze, get us out clean."
172. **Ben:** "Instead we got beat up by scared civilians and ran away."
173. **Ruth (snapping):** "We made the right call. Fighting would've proven Eidolon right."
174. **Tess:** "I know. But it sucks that she wasn't there."
175. **Korede (quiet):** "Where was she, though? Really?"
176. Silence. Team looking at Ruth.
177. **Ruth (uncertain for first time):** "I... I'll check on her. Make sure she's okay."
178. **Subtext:** Ruth starting to suspect something's wrong, but doesn't know what

### Beat 179-190: Ahdia's Apartment (Mystery, Not Answer)

179. **Cut to: Ahdia's apartment (simultaneous timeline)**
180. Ahdia alone, exhausted, hollow-eyed
181. Coffee table: Ryu's treatment equipment, vial empty (he was there earlier)
182. **Cost visible:** Sweating, shaking, cellular degradation worse than it should be
183. Phone shows missed calls: Ruth (6), Victor (2), Team group chat (15 messages)
184. She stares at phone, doesn't answer
185. **Internal conflict visible but reason unclear:** Guilt? Fear? Exhaustion?
186. TV on but muted, news coverage of something (we don't see what clearly)
187. **Ahdia (to phone, not calling back):** "I can't. Not yet."
188. **Why she can't:** Unclear. Treatment recovery? Something else?
189. She closes her eyes, fighting something (pain? memory? decision?)
190. **Mystery deepens:** WHERE was she? WHAT is she hiding? WHY won't she answer?

---

### BACKEND REFERENCE ONLY (Not Shown in Chapter)

**What Actually Happened:**

**Timeline (Simultaneous with Go Squad patrol):**
- While Go Squad was patrolling Caledonia (6 PM local time)
- Ahdia was in Jakarta, Indonesia (7 AM next day local time)
- Using FAERIS international access + translocation coords from Ryu
- Investigating arms deal that would fuel ethnic cleansing in East Africa

**What She Did:**
1. Froze time at private meeting (arms dealers + corrupt officials)
2. Read classified documents, found evidence of massacre planning (~11,000 targets)
3. Staged evidence so officials "discover" it themselves (manipulation)
4. Left psychological warfare message proving she can reach them anytime
5. Arms deal fell through due to "inexplicable" evidence discovery

**Costs:**
- Massive cellular degradation (16-20% burned in single operation)
- Would normally need treatment immediately
- Ryu came to her apartment after (cover story: routine treatment)
- Ryu provided: Intel about Jakarta situation + translocation coords + post-op treatment

**Why She Won't Answer Team:**
- Just got back from Jakarta 2 hours before team called
- Exhausted from massive power use
- Can't explain where she was without revealing secret operations
- Guilty team got hurt while she was gone, but believes saving 11,000 was worth it
- "They'd try to stop me" - knows Ruth would forbid this

**This Information Used For:**
- Consistency in later chapters when truth is revealed
- Tracking cellular degradation accurately across timeline
- Understanding Ryu's complicity (he knows about Jakarta)
- Ahdia's guilt/exhaustion is proportional to actual events
- Month 8 discovery scene will reference this specific operation

**Reader Discovery Timeline:**
- Chapter 5: Mystery established (WHERE is she?)
- Months 2-7: Pattern continues, suspicion grows
- Month 8: Ruth discovers truth, Jakarta mentioned specifically
- Flashback/explanation scene shows what we're documenting here

---

---

## SCENE 5: Chapter End - Parallel Realities

**Setting:** Split scene: CADENS medical bay / Ahdia's apartment

**Contrast:** Team together processing trauma / Ahdia alone with secret burden

### Beat 191-200: Team's Perspective

191. **Back to CADENS medical bay**
192. Ruth checking her phone: No response from Ahdia
193. **Ruth (to team):** "She's probably just resting. I'll check on her tomorrow."
194. **Victor:** "Want company? I can swing by—"
195. **Ruth:** "No. I'll handle it. She... she might need space."
196. **Tess:** "Space from what? We're her team."
197. **Ruth (can't explain the feeling):** "Just trust me. I'll make sure she's okay."
198. Team disperses, exhausted, processing first Eidolon encounter
199. **They don't know:** Their hero is fighting a different war
200. **Question hanging:** How long can Ahdia sustain dual-track operation?

### Beat 201-210: Ahdia's Hidden Burden

201. **Ahdia's apartment, late night**
202. She's watching footage on laptop: CADENS patrol cam (hacked access)
203. **Sees:** Team getting attacked by mob, Leah bleeding, team retreating
204. **Ahdia's guilt:** "I should have been there."
205. **Ahdia's justification (to herself):** "But I couldn't. I had to—"
206. **Stops herself, doesn't finish the thought**
207. **What she "had to" do:** Not revealed. The secret remains.
208. **Cost of choice visible:** Team got hurt without her, she's more isolated
209. **Ahdia (to empty apartment):** "They wouldn't understand. They'd try to stop me."
210. **Closes laptop, sits in dark, alone with secret she won't share**

### Beat 211-215: The Watcher Returns (Prime)

211. **External shot: Ahdia's building**
212. Rooftop across the street, figure in shadows watching her window
213. **Ahdia-Prime (readers don't know her identity yet)**
214. Watching younger self destroy herself trying to save everyone
215. **Prime (whispered):** "I did the same thing. It doesn't work. It never works."

### Beat 216-220: Chapter End Hook

216. Prime turns to leave, pauses
217. **Prime:** "But you won't listen until you've failed completely. None of us do."
218. Disappears into shadows (translocation? time power? unknown)
219. **Final image:** Ahdia's window, light going out, alone
220. **Central question established:** How long can she fight two wars before breaking?

---

## CHAPTER SUMMARY

### TTRPG Mechanics (Implied)

**Ruth (Leading patrol):**
- Task: Lead team through Eidolon encounter without Ahdia
- Success with cost: Team survives but injured, tactical retreat necessary
- Limitation: Can't save everyone (proven again - couldn't protect team from mob)

**Go Squad (Collective):**
- Task: De-escalate fear-amplified mob without fighting civilians
- Failure with grace: Couldn't de-escalate, but didn't prove Eidolon right by fighting
- Cost: Minor injuries, public perception worsened, morale damaged

**Ahdia (Absent):**
- Task: Unknown (deliberately obscured from reader)
- Result: Exhausted, degraded, guilty, won't answer calls
- Limitation: Isolation deepening, deception growing, carrying secret alone
- **Mystery:** What was she REALLY doing? Reader doesn't know yet.

### Dual-Track Structure Hinted (Not Revealed)

**Caledonia Track (Visible):**
- First clear Eidolon appearance
- Fear manipulation mechanism shown
- Book 1 callback (selfie civilian now terrified)
- Flash lynch mob (can't fight civilians)
- Impossible tactical situation
- Team processing trauma together

**Ahdia Track (Mystery):**
- Absent during crisis (treatment excuse)
- Exhaustion/degradation visible when seen
- Won't answer calls, isolating further
- Watching team footage, guilt evident
- **WHAT she was doing:** Not revealed
- **WHY she's hiding it:** Not revealed
- **Mystery established, answer withheld**

### Canon Elements

✓ **FAERIS evolving independently** - Drones function without Ahdia directing (10% autonomous, growing)
✓ **Treatment dependency** - Ahdia using it as excuse, Ryu complicit in cover story
✓ **Eidolon fear manipulation** - Amplifies existing fear, not creating new fear
✓ **Book 1 continuity** - Selfie civilian callback shows contrast
✓ **Prime watching** - Mystery figure observing Ahdia's mistakes

### Thematic Function

**"You Don't Have to Be Fixed to Be Worthy":**
- Team succeeds (survives) while injured/frightened (worthy while broken)
- Ahdia doing SOMETHING important while isolated/deceiving team (worthy while wrong - what is she doing?)
- Mob civilians not villains (terrified people, not evil - worthy while afraid)

**"CBT Approach Failing":**
- Ahdia trying to control something (what? readers don't know yet)
- Team trying to de-escalate rationally (Eidolon makes reason impossible)
- Ruth trying to keep everyone safe (can't protect from fear manipulation)

**"Both/And Thinking Needed":**
- Ahdia doing something important AND abandoning team (both true, what was she doing?)
- Team retreated AND acted heroically (both true, not cowardice)
- Civilians attacked AND are victims (both true, Eidolon is real threat)

### Setup for Book 2 Arc

**Immediate:**
- Eidolon established as antagonist (fear manipulation entity)
- Ahdia's dual-track operation visible to readers (team doesn't know yet)
- Ruth suspicious but rationalizing Ahdia's absences
- FAERIS independence becoming apparent

**Mid-Arc (Months 2-7):**
- Ahdia's absences increase, excuses wear thin
- Eidolon escalation (electoral manipulation, protest violence)
- Ruth notices degradation doesn't match team missions
- Ryu's complicity deepening (falsifying reports, providing intel)

**Discovery (Months 8-9):**
- Ruth discovers truth (Ahdia's global operations)
- Ryu's betrayal revealed (professional + personal)
- Team confrontation (outcomes vs methods)
- Major fracture (benevolent dictator revelation)

### Central Question

**"Where is Ahdia?"**

**Team's answer:** Treatment, degradation, medical needs
**Reader's answer (Chapter 5):** Unknown. Something's wrong, but what?
**Actual answer (backend only):** Jakarta operation, benevolent dictator beginning
**Truth revealed:** Month 8 (Ruth's discovery)

**Questions Chapter 5 Establishes:**
- WHERE was Ahdia during the mob attack?
- WHY is she so exhausted?
- WHAT is she hiding from the team?
- WHY won't she answer their calls?
- HOW long can she sustain this secret?

**Ultimate question:** How long before the truth breaks everything?

## SCENE 6: Systemic Failure - Isaiah Bennett Case Exoneration

**Setting:** Next morning after mob attack. Courthouse, CADENS safe house (team watching news), Isaiah's family home

**Timing:** Month 1, day after mob attack (moves chapter to early Month 2 territory)

**Present:** Team watching together, Tess processing father's complicity, Isaiah's family devastated

### Beat 221-235: The Announcement

221. **Morning after mob attack**, team gathered at safe house recovering
222. **News alert:** Grand jury decision in Isaiah Bennett case
223. **TV coverage:** Courthouse steps, prosecutor announcing decision
224. **Prosecutor:** "After thorough review, grand jury declines to indict Officer Marcus Webb"
225. **Team stunned silence** - evidence was overwhelming
226. **Prosecutor:** "Insufficient evidence to establish criminal intent beyond reasonable doubt"
227. **Legal speak masking:** We're not prosecuting, system protects its own
228. **Victor (quiet fury):** "Insufficient evidence? He shot an unarmed man at a peaceful protest."
229. **Ben:** "We have the body cam footage. Webb identified him as non-threat before shooting."
230. **Ruth:** "Evidence doesn't matter if the system won't use it."
231. **Leah:** "But everyone SAW it. It was on every news channel."
232. **Tess (watching her father on TV):** "And they're calling it justified anyway."
233. **Chief Whitford on screen:** "Difficult decision, officer followed protocol, tragic but necessary"
234. **Tess's face:** Horror, recognition - her father is protecting a killer
235. **Officer Marcus Webb's lawyer:** "Vindication for officer who acted in fear for his life"

### Beat 236-250: Isaiah's Family Response

236. **Cut to: Courthouse steps** - Isaiah's family emerging after grand jury announcement
237. **Isaiah's mother (Evelyn Bennett):** Mid-50s, devastated, community organizer
238. **Isaiah's younger sister (Kiana Bennett):** Early 20s, engineering student (following brother's path)
239. **Community supporters surrounding them** - 50+ people, signs reading "Justice for Isaiah"
240. **Evelyn (speaking to cameras, voice breaking):**
241. "They killed my son. We showed them the footage. We showed them the witnesses."
242. "We showed them Isaiah's engineering research - the truth he died trying to tell."
243. "And they said it wasn't enough. They said the officer who killed him was justified."
244. **Evelyn breaks down:** "What more could he have done? How was he supposed to survive being Black and right?"
245. **Kiana (supporting her mother):** "Isaiah was trying to save lives. He found safety violations. He reported contamination."
246. **Kiana:** "And Chief Whitford's department killed him for it. Called him a threat."
247. **Reporter:** "What will you do now?"
248. **Evelyn (through tears):** "We keep fighting. Because my son was RIGHT. And they killed him anyway."
249. **Kiana:** "Officer Webb is walking free. Back on duty. Still armed. Still dangerous."
250. **Community supporters chanting:** "Say his name! ISAIAH BENNETT!"

### Beat 251-265: Team Processing (Tess's Father)

251. **Back to safe house** - team watching courthouse coverage
252. **Tess (staring at screen, numb):** "That's my father. His department. His statement."
253. **Victor (gentle):** "Tess—"
254. **Tess:** "Don't. I know what you're going to say. 'Not your fault.' 'You're not him.'"
255. **Tess:** "But it IS his department. He CHOSE to protect Webb."
256. **Ruth:** "You can't control what your father does—"
257. **Tess (sharp):** "He's the police chief! He could have pushed for charges!"
258. **Ben:** "System protects itself. Chief Whitford is part of that system."
259. **Leah (quiet):** "Isaiah's mother looked... destroyed."
260. **Korede (who hasn't spoken):** "My mom knows her. They organized together after Isaiah died."
261. **Korede:** "Ms. Bennett used to say 'The truth will come out. Justice will come.'"
262. **Korede:** "Guess she was wrong."
263. **Victor:** "She wasn't wrong about the truth. We all saw what happened."
264. **Victor:** "She was wrong about justice. System doesn't care about truth."
265. **Tess:** "My father is part of that system. He's choosing this."

### Beat 266-280: Officer Webb Walks Free

266. **News coverage continues:** Officer Marcus Webb statement
267. **Webb (at police union press conference):** White, mid-30s, tactical unit
268. **Webb:** "Grateful for thorough investigation, difficult circumstances, feared for my life"
269. **Webb:** "Mr. Bennett's death is tragic, but I acted within department protocols"
270. **Translation visible to everyone:** Killed unarmed Black man, calling it protocol
271. **Police union president:** "Officer Webb will return to active duty next week"
272. **Ben (tactical analysis):** "They're putting him back on streets. Armed. Cleared."
273. **Ruth:** "With community knowing he killed Isaiah and walked away."
274. **Victor:** "That's the point. Show them the system protects cops who kill activists."
275. **Leah:** "Is that what we are now? Activists? Targets?"
276. **Ruth (realizing):** "We always were. Geneva defended enhanced individuals. She was assassinated."
277. **Ruth:** "Isaiah documented environmental crimes. He was killed at a protest."
278. **Ruth:** "System doesn't just protect killers. It ENABLES them."
279. **Tess (voice hollow):** "And my father is part of it."
280. **Korede (to himself):** "Officer Webb. Remember that name."

### Beat 281-295: The Parallel (Mob Attack + Exoneration)

281. **Ruth making connection:** "Yesterday, we were attacked by civilians made afraid of us."
282. **Ruth:** "Today, a cop who killed a civilian walks free because he was 'afraid.'"
283. **Ben:** "Both justified by fear. Both protected by system."
284. **Victor:** "Eidolon amplified fear of US. But fear of THEM?" (gestures to Webb on screen)
285. **Victor:** "System amplifies that itself. No entity needed."
286. **Tess:** "Isaiah wasn't enhanced. Wasn't powered. Just an engineer with evidence."
287. **Tess:** "And they killed him. Called it justified. Cleared the killer."
288. **Leah (processing):** "If they'll do that to someone like Isaiah..."
289. **Leah:** "What would they do to us? We're ACTUALLY enhanced."
290. **Ruth (the impossible math):** "We can't save everyone. Some things the system won't allow."
291. **Ben:** "So what do we do? Just accept it?"
292. **Victor:** "We document. We resist. We keep organizing."
293. **Ruth:** "And we accept that even perfect evidence won't always win."
294. **Team sitting in heavy silence** - mob attack + exoneration = system working as designed
295. **Both/and visible:** They're worthy to resist AND resistance isn't always enough

### Beat 296-310: Tess and Leta (Phone Call Setup)

296. **Tess's phone rings:** Leta calling
297. **Tess steps away from group**, answers
298. **Leta (over phone, urgent):** "Are you okay? I saw the news. Webb walked?"
299. **Tess:** "Yeah. My dad's department. He protected him."
300. **Leta:** "Tess, I'm so sorry—"
301. **Tess:** "Don't be sorry. Be careful."
302. **Leta:** "What?"
303. **Tess (fear leaking through):** "Webb is back on duty. Community knows he killed Isaiah."
304. **Tess:** "You're visible. Trans activist. Sex worker. You organize."
305. **Leta:** "I'm not stopping organizing because one cop—"
306. **Tess (urgent):** "One cop who KILLED someone like you and walked free!"
307. **Leta:** "Isaiah wasn't trans—"
308. **Tess:** "Isaiah was vulnerable and visible and RIGHT. Just like you."
309. **Tess:** "Webb killed him. System said it was fine. Webb is still out there."
310. **Leta (understanding Tess's fear):** "I'll be careful. I promise."

### Beat 311-320: Foreshadowing Leta's Death

311. **Tess:** "Please. Just... be careful at protests. At actions."
312. **Leta:** "I'm always careful—"
313. **Tess:** "Not careful enough. Not for this."
314. **Tess (can't explain why she's so scared):** "I love you. I need you to be safe."
315. **Leta (touched, but not understanding depth):** "I love you too. I'll be safe."
316. **Call ends** - Tess standing apart from team
317. **Korede watching Tess** (doesn't know she's his sister's girlfriend yet - secret relationship)
318. **Korede notices:** Tess is terrified for someone
319. **Ruth (approaching Tess):** "You okay?"
320. **Tess:** "No. But I will be."

### Beat 321-330: Chapter End - Two Systems

321. **Final montage:** Parallel systems
322. **Officer Webb** walking out of courthouse, free, badge and gun returned
323. **Isaiah's family** grieving on courthouse steps, justice denied
324. **Go Squad** processing in safe house, team still hurt from mob attack
325. **Ahdia** alone in apartment, isolated, watching news coverage
326. **Eidolon** (invisible) amplifying fear across city
327. **Both systems working:**
   - Fear manipulation entity making civilians afraid of heroes
   - Justice system making communities afraid cops can kill with impunity
328. **Ruth (voice over final images):** "We can't save everyone."
329. **Victor (voice over):** "But we try anyway."
330. **Final image:** Officer Marcus Webb in uniform, back on patrol, weapon holstered
331. **Title card:** **9 months until Leta's death**

## UPDATED CHAPTER SUMMARY

**Chapter 5 (Late Month 1 / Early Month 2) now includes:**

### Original Structure:
- Scenes 1-5: Eidolon mob attack, Ahdia's mysterious absence (Beats 1-220)

### NEW Addition:
- Scene 6: Isaiah Bennett case exoneration, Officer Webb walks free (Beats 221-331)

### What This Adds:

**Isaiah Bennett Arc:**
- Officer Marcus Webb named specifically
- Exoneration shown immediately (not delayed until Month 9)
- Webb back on duty, armed, cleared by system
- 9 months of dread before he kills Leta (Month 11)
- Tess processing father's complicity early
- Leta warned but dismissive (foreshadowing)

**Systemic Theme:**
- Eidolon amplifies fear of heroes
- Justice system amplifies fear OF consequences (cops can kill)
- Both systems working in parallel
- Ruth's "can't save everyone" established early

**Character Development:**
- **Tess:** Father protected killer, relationship permanently damaged
- **Korede:** Remembering Webb's name, radicalization seeding
- **Leta:** Warned by Tess, doesn't take it seriously enough (tragic irony)
- **Team:** Evidence perfect, justice denied, resistance necessary anyway

**Foreshadowing:**
- Webb named, faced, walks free
- 9 months of him being armed and dangerous on streets
- Tess's specific fear for Leta established
- "Remember that name" (Korede) pays off when Webb kills Leta

### Updated Status:

**Chapter 5 structure complete:**
- **331 beats across 6 scenes** (was 220 across 5)
- Dual-track structure (team vs Ahdia)
- Eidolon introduction (mob attack)
- **Isaiah Bennett exoneration (NEW - Officer Webb established)**
- Prime watching (mystery continues)
- Central questions: Where is Ahdia? + What will system do to protect itself?

**Ready for:**
- Prose conversion
- Integration with Chapters 3-4
- Continuation: Webb remains threat until Month 11 when he kills Leta
