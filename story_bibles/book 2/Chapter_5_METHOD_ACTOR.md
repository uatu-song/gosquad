# Chapter 5 - Method Actor Draft

**Title:** Where is Ahdia?

**Structure:**
1. Pre-patrol briefing (Ahdia absent)
2. Patrol begins—civilians shift from friendly to afraid
3. Flash mob attack (Eidolon's first clear appearance)
4. CADENS debrief—Eidolon named
5. Parallel isolation (team together / Ahdia alone)
6. Isaiah Bennett exoneration (Officer Webb walks free)

**Central Question:** Where is Ahdia when the team needs her?

---

## SCENE 1: Pre-Patrol Briefing

**Touchpoint A:** Team gathers for routine patrol, Ahdia's absence noted
**Touchpoint B:** Team proceeds without her, rationalizing the excuse

**Setting:** CADENS command center. Evening. Go Squad prepping for patrol.

**Present:** Ruth, Ben, Victor, Tess, Leah, Korede. Ahdia NOT present.

---

[NARRATOR]: The command center hummed with its usual low-grade anxiety—screens tracking news feeds, FAERIS drones running pre-flight checks, the smell of recycled air and too much coffee. Ruth stood at the holo-map, tracing their patrol route through downtown Caledonia.

Six blocks. Routine presence. Show the community that enhanced individuals weren't the monsters Kain's campaign claimed.

[AS VICTOR, noticing the empty chair]:
"Is Ahdia meeting us there, or...?"

[NARRATOR]: Ruth checked her comm. The message had come in an hour ago.

[AS RUTH, reading]:
"She said she'd catch up. Treatment ran long."

[AS TESS, quiet, to Korede]:
"That's the third time this week."

[NARRATOR]: Korede shrugged. He didn't know Ahdia well enough to judge—hadn't seen her at full strength, didn't understand what "treatment" meant or what it cost. To him, she was just the time-freezer who sometimes wasn't there.

[AS BEN, practical]:
"We've done patrols without her before. FAERIS is still functional."

[AS RUTH, nodding but uncertain]:
"Right. Let's go over the parameters."

[NARRATOR]: Something felt off. Ruth couldn't name it—just a tightness in her chest that had started appearing whenever Ahdia's name came up. The absences were getting longer. The excuses were getting thinner.

But that was a problem for another time.

[AS RUTH, team leader voice]:
"Objective: Community presence. After Geneva, after the riots, people are nervous about enhanced individuals. We show them we're safe."

[AS LEAH, uncertain]:
"Are we though? Safe?"

[AS VICTOR, firm]:
"We're on their side. That's what matters."

[AS TESS]:
"Tell that to the news coverage. We're 'dangerous vigilantes' this week."

[AS RUTH]:
"Which is why we're doing this. Show up, be visible, be helpful. No confrontations. No power displays. Just presence."

[NARRATOR]: Ryu's voice crackled over comms.

[AS RYU, over comms]:
"FAERIS diagnostics complete. All drones operational."

[AS RUTH]:
"Even without Ahdia directing them?"

[AS RYU, careful]:
"They've been developing autonomous support patterns. Should maintain effectiveness."

[NARRATOR]: The team didn't realize what that meant—that the drones were working independently now, making their own decisions about when and how to help. FAERIS was evolving. Ten percent autonomous and growing.

[AS RUTH]:
"Good. Let's move out."

## DIRECTOR NOTES - Scene 1

**Requirements met:**
- [x] Ahdia's absence established (treatment excuse)
- [x] Team notices pattern but rationalizes
- [x] FAERIS autonomy mentioned
- [x] Patrol parameters set (presence, not confrontation)

**State changes:**
- Team status: Proceeding without Ahdia (becoming normal)
- Ruth status: Suspicious but not confronting yet

**Consequences propagating:**
- "Third time this week" = pattern visible
- FAERIS independence foreshadows Book 2B

---

## SCENE 2: Patrol Begins - The Shift

**Touchpoint A:** Normal civilian interactions, friendly reception
**Touchpoint B:** Atmosphere shifts—Eidolon's influence becomes visible

**Setting:** Downtown Caledonia. Evening. City streets.

**Present:** Go Squad minus Ahdia. FAERIS overhead.

---

[NARRATOR]: The first few blocks felt almost normal. Pedestrians recognized them, waved, took photos. A woman in a Geneva Windrow campaign shirt gave them a thumbs up. A kid asked Ben if he was really a sniper.

[AS BEN, to the kid]:
"Not tonight. Tonight I'm just walking."

[AS KID, disappointed]:
"That's less cool."

[AS BEN, slight smile]:
"Yeah. It is."

[NARRATOR]: Victor fell into step beside a man he recognized from the community center—brief handshake, quick conversation about the memorial service planning. This was what they'd come for. Connection. Presence. Proof that enhanced individuals were people too.

Then they crossed into the next block.

[AS LEAH, noticing]:
"Is it just me, or did the vibe just... change?"

[NARRATOR]: The pedestrian traffic thinned. People who'd been walking toward them suddenly found reasons to cross the street. Eye contact vanished. A woman pulled her child closer and hurried past without looking.

[AS BEN, scanning]:
"No hostile signatures. No threats detected."

[NARRATOR]: But people were definitely avoiding them.

FAERIS chimed an alert in Ruth's earpiece.

[AS FAERIS]:
"EM anomaly detected. Localized, faint signature. Unknown origin."

[AS RUTH]:
"Ryu, are you seeing this?"

[AS RYU, over comms]:
"Confirmed. Unknown energy pattern. Not cataclysm-derived, but... unusual."

[NARRATOR]: The pattern was subtle—easy to miss if you weren't looking. But something was affecting the area around the Go Squad. Making people afraid.

[AS VICTOR]:
"What IS that? People are acting like we're contagious."

[NARRATOR]: Ruth's HUD displayed the analysis: Fear response amplification. Fifty-meter radius. Centered on their position.

Something was making people afraid of them.

[NARRATOR]: They approached a corner. Ruth saw a familiar face—young woman, early twenties, phone in hand. The same civilian who'd wanted a selfie with "real heroes" last month.

[AS VICTOR, recognizing her]:
"Hey! You're the one who wanted the selfie, right? After the thing at the park?"

[NARRATOR]: The woman froze. Last month, she'd been excited. Starstruck. Asked Victor to pose while she took a dozen photos.

Now she backed away, fear visible in every line of her body.

[AS VICTOR]:
"It's okay, we're just—"

[AS SELFIE WOMAN, scared]:
"Stay away from me."

[AS VICTOR, confused]:
"What? We met before. You were excited—"

[AS SELFIE WOMAN]:
"That was before. Before Geneva died. Before... just stay back!"

[NARRATOR]: She turned and hurried away, nearly running.

The team stood frozen. Same person. Same street. Completely different reaction.

[AS TESS]:
"What the hell just happened?"

[AS BEN]:
"EM signature spiked when she saw us. Ryu, confirm?"

[AS RYU]:
"Confirmed. Pattern intensified during interaction. It's affecting emotional response."

[AS LEAH]:
"You're saying something's making people afraid of us?"

[AS RUTH, realizing]:
"Not making them afraid. Amplifying existing fear."

[AS VICTOR]:
"But she wasn't afraid of us last month. She wanted a photo!"

[AS RUTH]:
"Last month, Geneva was alive. Media wasn't calling us dangerous. This thing—whatever it is—takes existing fear and cranks it to eleven."

[NARRATOR]: More pedestrians were noticing them now. Fear responses spreading like ripples. People backing away, pulling out phones, whispering to each other.

[AS KOREDE, quiet]:
"We should leave. We're making it worse."

---

## DIRECTOR NOTES - Scene 2

**Requirements met:**
- [x] Normal interactions → shift to fear
- [x] Book 1 callback (selfie civilian now terrified)
- [x] Eidolon's mechanism demonstrated (amplification, not creation)
- [x] EM signature analysis showing fear manipulation

**State changes:**
- Public response: Friendly → afraid
- Team knowledge: Something is manipulating fear (don't know what yet)

**Consequences propagating:**
- Same person, opposite reaction = visible proof
- "Amplifies existing fear" = key mechanism

---

## SCENE 3: Flash Mob Attack

**Touchpoint A:** Fear escalates into mob formation
**Touchpoint B:** Team retreats without fighting civilians

**Setting:** Same patrol route, 10 minutes later. Crowd forming.

**Present:** Go Squad (no Ahdia). FAERIS. Growing civilian crowd.

---

[NARRATOR]: Ruth made the call to stay. Running would prove Eidolon—whatever it was—right. They were supposed to be community presence.

Ten minutes later, she wasn't sure that had been the right decision.

The crowd had grown. Thirty people, maybe forty. Whispers spreading faster than the team could move.

[AS CIVILIAN]:
"They're here. The ones Geneva defended before she died."

[AS ANOTHER CIVILIAN]:
"She died BECAUSE of them. They brought this on us."

[AS THIRD CIVILIAN]:
"Dangerous freaks. Shouldn't be allowed in our neighborhood."

[NARRATOR]: The fear was turning to anger. Ruth could see it in their postures—shoulders forward, fists clenching. The EM signature was screaming in her earpiece. Two hundred percent of baseline.

[AS VICTOR, recognizing the pattern]:
"This is a mob. This is a lynch mob forming."

[AS RUTH]:
"Everyone stay calm. Defensive postures only."

[NARRATOR]: The first bottle came from somewhere in the back of the crowd. It shattered near Ben's feet.

[AS BEN, comm to team]:
"We don't engage. Defensive only."

[NARRATOR]: More objects followed. Rocks. Cans. Someone's shoe. A piece of pipe.

[AS LEAH, hit by something]:
"They're actually attacking us!"

[AS RUTH]:
"Shields up. FAERIS, defensive perimeter only."

[NARRATOR]: The drones formed a barrier, deflecting projectiles without attacking. But the crowd kept pressing forward, fear-fueled rage making reason impossible.

[AS TESS, furious]:
"We can't fight civilians. That's exactly what this WANTS."

[AS RUTH]:
"Whoever's doing this wants us to prove we're dangerous."

[AS VICTOR]:
"Well they're doing a great job, because I feel pretty dangerous right now!"

[NARRATOR]: Someone grabbed Korede's arm, trying to pull him from formation. Tess yanked him back, shoving the civilian away—defensive, not aggressive.

The crowd erupted.

[AS MOB]:
"SEE! THEY'RE VIOLENT!"

[NARRATOR]: Perfect. Turn defense into proof of danger. Whatever was amplifying their fear knew exactly what it was doing.

[AS RUTH, decisive]:
"Fall back. Now. FAERIS, cover retreat."

[AS BEN]:
"If Ahdia were here, she could freeze them. Get us out clean."

[AS VICTOR]:
"Well she's NOT here. We work with what we have."

[NARRATOR]: They retreated toward an alley, FAERIS drones forming a screen. The projectiles were getting more dangerous—metal, glass, someone had a length of rebar.

A rock caught Leah on the forehead. Blood ran down into her eye.

[AS LEAH]:
"I'm bleeding—"

[AS RUTH]:
"Keep moving. Don't stop."

[AS RUTH, into comms]:
"Ryu, we need extraction. Translocation to CADENS. Now."

[AS RYU]:
"Coordinates locked. Thirty seconds."

[NARRATOR]: Thirty seconds felt like thirty years. The mob reached the alley entrance. Someone swung a pipe at Ben. He blocked it—defensive, didn't strike back—but took the hit on his forearm.

[AS KOREDE, frightened]:
"They're going to kill us—"

[AS VICTOR]:
"No. They're scared. Being MADE scared. Not their fault."

[NARRATOR]: The translocation activated. Blue flash. The team disappeared.

The mob stood in the empty alley, confused, the EM signature fading. Whatever had gripped them was passing. People looked at each other, at their own hands, at the blood on the concrete.

[AS VOICE FROM MOB]:
"What... what happened?"

[NARRATOR]: None of them would remember why they'd attacked. None of them would understand.

---

## DIRECTOR NOTES - Scene 3

**Requirements met:**
- [x] Mob attack without team fighting back
- [x] Impossible tactical situation (fight = prove enemy right)
- [x] "Where is Ahdia?" question explicit
- [x] Team retreats with injuries but doesn't prove Eidolon right
- [x] Victor's compassion: "Not their fault"

**State changes:**
- Team status: Injured, traumatized, retreated
- Public perception: Worsened (vigilantes "violent")
- Eidolon: First clear victory

**Consequences propagating:**
- Pattern established: Can't fight fear with force
- Ahdia's absence = real cost
- Team needs new strategy

---

## SCENE 4: CADENS Medical Bay - Eidolon Named

**Touchpoint A:** Team processing the attack, injuries treated
**Touchpoint B:** Bourn names the entity: Eidolon

**Setting:** CADENS medical bay. Team being treated.

**Present:** Go Squad (no Ahdia), Ruth, Ryu, Bourn.

---

[NARRATOR]: The medical bay smelled like antiseptic and failure. Leah's forehead was stitched. Ben's ribs were bruised. Everyone had scrapes, cuts, the kind of minor injuries that felt major when civilians inflicted them.

[AS TESS, furious]:
"We got attacked by CIVILIANS. Regular people with rocks and bottles."

[AS LEAH, shaking]:
"They wanted to kill us. I saw it in their eyes."

[AS VICTOR]:
"They were terrified. Something made them terrified of us."

[NARRATOR]: Bourn entered, her presence filling the room the way it always did. Power recognizing wounded power.

[AS BOURN]:
"Not just amplification. Targeted emotional manipulation."

[AS RUTH]:
"You know what this is?"

[AS BOURN]:
"We've been tracking similar patterns. Different cities, always targeting enhanced individuals. Someone's making people's existing fears unbearable."

[AS BEN]:
"Who? What are we dealing with?"

[AS BOURN]:
"We don't know yet. But it's organized, intelligent, and escalating."

[NARRATOR]: Ryu pulled up data on the main screen.

[AS RYU]:
"Energy signature doesn't match known cataclysm artifacts. But the pattern matches something from Conclave archives."

[AS BOURN]:
"Fear manipulation entities. Rare, extremely dangerous."

[AS RUTH]:
"Entities? As in... alive?"

[AS BOURN]:
"Sentient. Feeds on fear, amplifies fear, creates feedback loops."

[AS TESS]:
"So a fear monster. Great. Just what we needed."

[AS BOURN]:
"Conclave designation: Eidolon. Fear-class entity."

[AS LEAH]:
"Eidolon? Like... a ghost?"

[AS VICTOR]:
"Greek. An idealized phantom. Something that haunts based on perception."

[AS RUTH]:
"How do we fight something that makes people afraid of us?"

[AS BOURN]:
"That's the problem. Traditional tactics won't work. Every action you take, it'll twist into proof you're dangerous."

[AS BEN]:
"So we're in an impossible situation."

[AS BOURN]:
"Exactly."

[NARRATOR]: Silence settled over the medical bay. The team had faced enhanced criminals, cosmic artifacts, a kaiju. But an enemy that turned regular people into weapons? That made your existence proof of your danger?

[AS RUTH, exhausted]:
"We need everyone on this. Full team assessment."

[AS TESS]:
"Where IS Ahdia, anyway? We could've used her out there."

[AS RUTH]:
"Treatment. She'll be back soon."

[AS VICTOR, skeptical]:
"Treatment's been taking longer lately. You notice that?"

[AS RUTH, defensive]:
"Cellular degradation varies. Sometimes it takes time."

[AS LEAH]:
"But we could have REALLY used her. Time freeze, get us out clean."

[AS BEN]:
"Instead we got beat up by scared civilians and ran away."

[AS RUTH, snapping]:
"We made the right call. Fighting would've proven Eidolon right."

[AS TESS]:
"I know. But it sucks that she wasn't there."

[AS KOREDE, quiet]:
"Where was she, though? Really?"

[NARRATOR]: Silence. Everyone looking at Ruth.

[AS RUTH, uncertain]:
"I'll check on her. Make sure she's okay."

## DIRECTOR NOTES - Scene 4

**Requirements met:**
- [x] Team processing trauma together
- [x] Eidolon officially named
- [x] Bourn provides institutional context
- [x] "Where is Ahdia?" question now pointed
- [x] Ruth's suspicion growing

**State changes:**
- Team knowledge: Eidolon is real, named, dangerous
- Ruth status: Defending Ahdia but starting to doubt
- Investigation: New enemy identified

**Consequences propagating:**
- Eidolon = ongoing threat throughout Book 2
- Ahdia's absences becoming team concern
- Ruth will have to confront the truth eventually

---

## SCENE 5: Parallel Isolation

**Touchpoint A:** Team together processing / Ahdia alone
**Touchpoint B:** Mystery deepens—what is Ahdia hiding?

**Setting:** Split scene: CADENS / Ahdia's apartment

**POV:** Shifts between Ruth and Ahdia

---

[NARRATOR]: Ruth checked her phone again. Six missed calls. Fifteen messages in the team chat. Nothing from Ahdia.

[AS RUTH, to team]:
"She's probably just resting. I'll check on her tomorrow."

[AS VICTOR]:
"Want company? I can swing by—"

[AS RUTH]:
"No. I'll handle it. She... she might need space."

[AS TESS]:
"Space from what? We're her team."

[AS RUTH]:
"Just trust me. I'll make sure she's okay."

[NARRATOR]: The team dispersed, exhausted, processing their first Eidolon encounter. None of them knew what their hero was really doing.

---

[NARRATOR]: Ahdia's apartment. Late night. The lights were off.

She sat on the couch, hollow-eyed, sweating despite the cold. Ryu's equipment was still on the coffee table—the vial empty, the treatment administered hours ago.

Her phone showed the missed calls. Ruth. Victor. The group chat scrolling with messages she couldn't answer.

[AS AHDIA, to herself]:
"I can't. Not yet."

[NARRATOR]: On her laptop, patrol cam footage played on loop. The mob attack. Leah's blood. The team retreating.

She'd watched it three times.

[AS AHDIA, internal]:
I should have been there.

[NARRATOR]: But she couldn't have been. Not without revealing where she'd actually gone. What she'd actually done.

The news ticker at the bottom of her screen showed something about an arms deal falling through in Southeast Asia. Inexplicable evidence discovery. Officials declining to comment.

Nobody would connect that to the woman sitting alone in a Caledonia penthouse.

[AS AHDIA, to the empty room]:
"They wouldn't understand. They'd try to stop me."

[NARRATOR]: She closed the laptop. Sat in the dark. The Hyper Seed in her chest was cold—always cold now, after what she'd burned to get home in time to not answer their calls.

Somewhere across the city, the team was together. Processing. Healing.

Ahdia was alone with a secret she couldn't share.

---

[NARRATOR]: External shot. Ahdia's building.

On the rooftop across the street, a figure stood in shadow, watching the window where Ahdia's light had just gone out.

She looked like Ahdia. Older. Tired in ways that had nothing to do with sleep.

[AS PRIME, whispered]:
"I did the same thing. It doesn't work. It never works."

[NARRATOR]: She turned to leave. Paused.

[AS PRIME]:
"But you won't listen until you've failed completely. None of us do."

[NARRATOR]: She disappeared. Translocation, time power, something else—impossible to tell.

The window stayed dark.

---

## DIRECTOR NOTES - Scene 5

**Requirements met:**
- [x] Team together / Ahdia isolated (parallel structure)
- [x] Mystery deepened (news ticker hint about what she did)
- [x] Ahdia's guilt visible
- [x] Prime watching (recurring mystery figure)
- [x] Central question: How long can she sustain this?

**State changes:**
- Ahdia isolation: Deepening
- Reader knowledge: Something secret, not revealed
- Prime: Established as observer

**Consequences propagating:**
- Ahdia's pattern will continue until Month 8 discovery
- Prime will return for Book 2 climax
- Team concern will grow

---

## SCENE 6: Isaiah Bennett Case - Exoneration

**Touchpoint A:** Grand jury declines to indict Officer Webb
**Touchpoint B:** Webb back on duty, Tess warns Leta

**Setting:** Next morning. Safe house (team watching news), courthouse steps.

---

[NARRATOR]: Morning after the mob attack. The team had gathered at the safe house, still bruised, still processing. Someone turned on the news.

[AS NEWS ANCHOR]:
"Breaking: Grand jury decision in the Isaiah Bennett case..."

[NARRATOR]: Ruth turned up the volume. The screen showed courthouse steps, a prosecutor at a podium, cameras flashing.

[AS PROSECUTOR, on screen]:
"After thorough review, the grand jury declines to indict Officer Marcus Webb in the death of Isaiah Bennett."

[NARRATOR]: Silence in the safe house.

[AS PROSECUTOR]:
"Insufficient evidence to establish criminal intent beyond reasonable doubt."

[AS VICTOR, quiet fury]:
"Insufficient evidence? He shot an unarmed man at a peaceful protest."

[AS BEN]:
"We have the body cam footage. Webb identified him as non-threat before shooting."

[AS RUTH]:
"Evidence doesn't matter if the system won't use it."

[NARRATOR]: The screen cut to the courthouse steps. Isaiah's mother emerging, face devastated, community supporters surrounding her.

[AS EVELYN BENNETT, voice breaking]:
"They killed my son. We showed them the footage. We showed them the witnesses. We showed them Isaiah's engineering research—the truth he died trying to tell. And they said it wasn't enough."

[NARRATOR]: She broke down. Her daughter, Kiana, supported her.

[AS EVELYN]:
"What more could he have done? How was he supposed to survive being Black and right?"

[NARRATOR]: In the safe house, the team watched in heavy silence. Then the screen cut to a police union press conference. Officer Marcus Webb at the podium—white, mid-thirties, tactical unit.

[AS WEBB]:
"Grateful for the thorough investigation. Difficult circumstances. I feared for my life."

[NARRATOR]: Translation visible to everyone: Killed unarmed Black man, calling it protocol.

[AS POLICE UNION PRESIDENT]:
"Officer Webb will return to active duty next week."

[AS BEN]:
"They're putting him back on streets. Armed. Cleared."

[AS RUTH]:
"With the community knowing he killed Isaiah and walked away."

[AS VICTOR]:
"That's the point. Show them the system protects cops who kill activists."

[NARRATOR]: Ruth made the connection.

[AS RUTH]:
"Yesterday, we were attacked by civilians made afraid of us. Today, a cop who killed a civilian walks free because he was 'afraid.'"

[AS BEN]:
"Both justified by fear. Both protected by systems."

[AS VICTOR]:
"Eidolon amplified fear of US. But fear of THEM?" He gestured at Webb on screen. "System amplifies that itself. No entity needed."

[NARRATOR]: Tess hadn't spoken. She was staring at the screen where her father—Chief Whitford—was giving his statement.

[AS CHIEF WHITFORD, on screen]:
"Difficult decision. Officer followed protocol. Tragic but necessary."

[AS TESS, hollow]:
"That's my father. His department. His statement."

[AS VICTOR, gentle]:
"Tess—"

[AS TESS]:
"Don't. I know what you're going to say. 'Not your fault.' 'You're not him.' But it IS his department. He CHOSE to protect Webb."

[NARRATOR]: Her phone buzzed. Leta calling.

Tess stepped away from the group, answered.

[AS LETA, over phone]:
"Are you okay? I saw the news. Webb walked?"

[AS TESS]:
"Yeah. My dad's department. He protected him."

[AS LETA]:
"Tess, I'm so sorry—"

[AS TESS]:
"Don't be sorry. Be careful."

[AS LETA]:
"What?"

[AS TESS, fear leaking through]:
"Webb is back on duty. Community knows he killed Isaiah. You're visible. Trans activist. Sex worker organizer. You organize protests."

[AS LETA]:
"I'm not stopping because one cop—"

[AS TESS, urgent]:
"One cop who KILLED someone like you and walked free!"

[AS LETA]:
"Isaiah wasn't trans—"

[AS TESS]:
"Isaiah was vulnerable and visible and RIGHT. Just like you. Webb killed him. System said it was fine. Webb is still out there."

[NARRATOR]: Pause on the line.

[AS LETA, understanding]:
"I'll be careful. I promise."

[AS TESS]:
"Please. I love you. I need you to be safe."

[AS LETA]:
"I love you too. I'll be safe."

[NARRATOR]: The call ended. Tess stood apart from the team, phone in her hand, fear in her chest that she couldn't explain.

Korede was watching her. He didn't know yet that Tess was his sister's girlfriend. Didn't know the weight of what he'd just witnessed.

But he noticed: Tess was terrified for someone.

---

[NARRATOR]: Final montage. Parallel systems.

Officer Marcus Webb walking out of the courthouse. Free. Badge and gun returned.

Isaiah's family grieving on the steps. Justice denied.

Go Squad in the safe house. Still hurt from the mob. Now watching the system declare itself.

Ahdia in her apartment. Isolated. News coverage playing without sound.

And somewhere unseen, Eidolon. Amplifying fear across the city.

[AS RUTH, voice over]:
"We can't save everyone."

[AS VICTOR, voice over]:
"But we try anyway."

[NARRATOR]: Final image: Officer Marcus Webb in uniform. Back on patrol. Weapon holstered. Waiting.

**Title card: 9 months until Leta's death.**

---

## Chapter 5 Summary

**What happened:**
1. Team patrolled without Ahdia (treatment excuse)
2. Civilians shifted from friendly to terrified (Eidolon)
3. Flash mob attacked team—they retreated without fighting
4. Eidolon officially named by Bourn
5. Ahdia shown isolated, hiding something, watching team footage
6. Isaiah Bennett case: Webb exonerated, back on streets

**Dual-track structure established:**
- Team track: Fighting Eidolon, dealing with public fear
- Ahdia track: Secret global operations (not revealed to reader yet)
- System track: Webb walks free, 9 months until he kills again

**Seeds planted:**
- Eidolon = ongoing threat
- Ahdia's absences = growing concern
- Prime watching = mystery deepens
- Webb + Leta = tragedy countdown
- Tess/Whitford = institutional betrayal

**Reader perspective:**
- Worried about Ahdia (what is she hiding?)
- Horrified by Webb walking free
- Understanding fear as weapon (Eidolon and system)
- Doesn't know Ahdia's global operations yet
