# Chapter 2 Method Actor Briefing

**Chapter:** The Assassination
**Timeline:** Month 1, three days after Chapter 1 riot

---

## NARRATOR PERFORMANCES

### Scenes 1-4: [AS NARRATOR - AHDIA POV]

**State Tags:** `post-riot, depleted, hypervigilant, first-assassination-witness`

**Ahdia's Current State:**
- Baseline: 67-68% (dropped 23 points in Chapter 1)
- Physical: Nosebleeds stopped, still recovering, needs treatment soon
- Emotional: Carrying Daniel Okonkwo (31, accountant)—the one she couldn't save
- Mental: Hypervigilant after riot, scanning for threats she can actually stop

**Narrator Filter:**
- She's watching a political debate like it's a TV show she doesn't understand
- "Fancy people politics" = she doesn't belong in this world
- Scanning for threats = wrong threat model (expecting crowd violence, not military sniper)
- When assassination happens: First real-time horror she can't process through TV frame
- Post-assassination: Exhausted narrator voice, shorter sentences, less humor

**What She Notices:**
- Security details that feel like theater
- Her own uselessness standing in the wings
- EM pressure in her chest (Eidolon is present—not embodied, but localized as a sentient presence; she doesn't know what it is, just feels it)
- Geneva actually caring about vulnerable people (rare)
- Kain's calm (too calm, wrong calm)

**What She Misses:**
- The sniper three buildings away
- The coordination required for this hit
- That she COULD have stopped it if she'd known (the tragedy is information failure, not capability failure—Ahdia-Prime tried this timeline repeatedly)

---

### Scene 5: [AS NARRATOR - KAIN POV]

**State Tags:** `triumphant, calculating, viewing-people-as-assets`

**Kain's Current State:**
- Political: Up 12 points in polls, Geneva eliminated
- Emotional: No grief, only satisfaction at successful operation
- Mental: Already planning next moves, CADENS control, treatment leverage

**Narrator Filter (Kain's perception):**
- People are assets, obstacles, or irrelevant
- Numbers matter (polling, points, leverage)
- Control is the only value
- Geneva's death = strategic outcome, not tragedy
- Go Squad = useful tools with exploitable dependencies

**Voice Shift from Ahdia:**
- No pop culture references
- No self-deprecation
- No tangents or ADHD attention
- Cold, transactional observations
- Satisfaction without joy (control, not happiness)

**What Kain Notices:**
- Polling numbers (immediate)
- Narrative control success
- Leverage opportunities
- Asset positioning

**What Kain Misses:**
- Human cost (doesn't register as real)
- That Go Squad might actually investigate effectively
- His own moral hollowness

## CHARACTER PERFORMANCES

### Ruth Carter (Nightingale)
**Voice:** Medical precision, team leader, carrying Firas grief
**State:** Leadership under impossible circumstances
**Traits to show:**
- Calm commands under pressure
- Diagnostic thinking (assess, triage, assign)
- Almost says Firas's name when comforting Ahdia—catches herself
- "You can't save everyone" = lesson she learned the hard way

**Sample line style:**
> "Everyone in position?"
> "Ahdia, how are you feeling? After the riot?"
> "Then hold it short! Just redirect the bottlenecks!"

---

### Ben Bukowski (Night Knight)
**Voice:** Military precision, fragments under tactical mode, investigator
**State:** Training kicks in—this is what he knows
**Traits to show:**
- Instant trajectory analysis when shot fires
- Moves toward threat, not away
- Recognizes professional setup (military-grade, expert level)
- Connects cataclysm tech to Firas (careful, not accusatory)

**Sample line style:**
> "North balcony clear. Good sightlines."
> "SNIPER! Northwest vector, high angle!"
> "800 meter shot, moving target, headshot. That's expert level."

---

### Tess Whitford (Gloom Girl)
**Voice:** Gen Z, dark humor as deflection, damaged
**State:** Shock processing through inappropriate jokes
**Traits to show:**
- Sarcasm when she can't handle reality
- "Sorry. Shock talking." = aware of her coping mechanism
- Father's department will be involved in this somehow (she dreads it)

**Sample line style:**
> "Well, that's a first. Live assassination. Not even on pay-per-view."
> "Sorry. Shock talking. I got nothing else right now."
> "I'm saying he benefits. And he was READY."

---

### Leah Turner (Battlea)
**Voice:** Direct, physical, anger-managed
**State:** Shaking—she was ten rows away, saw it happen
**Traits to show:**
- Physical shock (shaking, needs grounding)
- Victor's comfort helps
- Less verbal than usual (processing physically)

**Sample line style:**
> "I was right there. Ten rows away. I saw—"

---

### Victor Hernandez (Crimson Sable)
**Voice:** Community-oriented, carries grief, protective
**State:** Protecting Leah, honoring the dead
**Traits to show:**
- Hugs Leah, tells her not to process yet
- Names Isaiah Bennett (the death that started this)
- Quiet grief that recognizes other grief

**Sample line style:**
> "Don't process it yet. Not here. Later."
> "Isaiah deserved better than this."

---

### Geneva Windrow
**Voice:** Poised, experienced, compassionate politician
**State:** Delivering opening statement (her final words)
**Note:** She dies mid-sentence. Her last words are about protecting vulnerable people.

**Sample line style:**
> "Caledonia's most vulnerable—Black communities, immigrants, trans folks, sex workers—these are the people being pushed out..."
> "We can protect our most vulnerable citizens—" [SHOT]

---

### Harding Kain (Scene 5 only)
**Voice:** Switches between smooth politician and cold calculator
**State:** Triumphant, planning next moves
**Traits to show:**
- No grief performance when cameras off
- Views people as assets with leverage points
- References Tank Kain casually (massacre is just business)
- Plans to control CADENS through presidency
- Treatment dependency = weapon

**Sample line style:**
> "Geneva's martyrdom. People want strength now, not compassion."
> "Every enhanced individual depends on CADENS for treatment. Including their time manipulator."
> "When I need them to stop, I'll just cut off their treatment supply."

## SCENE-BY-SCENE NARRATOR STATE

### Scene 1: The Memorial
**Ahdia state:** Bored vigilance, feeling useless, guilt about Daniel
**Rhythm:** Normal Ahdia—tangents, TV processing, self-deprecation
**Shift:** EM pressure builds, HUD freaks out, something's wrong

### Scene 2: Forty Seconds
**Ahdia state:** Horror, then forced action, then collapse
**Rhythm:** Choppy during panic, fragmentary during freeze, exhausted after
**Key moment:** Freeze breaks involuntarily—body overrules will. Saves 3, fails to reach 4th.

### Scene 3: Team Regroup
**Note:** Ben's rooftop analysis delivered as verbal report here, not standalone scene.
**Ahdia state:** Exhausted, guilty, nosebleeding again
**Rhythm:** Shorter sentences, less humor, more flat statements
**Key moment:** Ben's findings + mystery figure sighting

### Scene 4: Kain's Victory Lap
**POV SHIFT:** Kain narrator, not Ahdia
**Rhythm:** Cold, transactional, no tangents, satisfaction without joy
**Key moment:** "When I need them to stop, I'll just cut off their treatment supply."

## MYSTERY FIGURE (Scene 3 end)

**Visual only—no dialogue.**

What Ahdia sees:
- Rooftop across the street
- Hooded figure watching her specifically
- Purple lightning flickers around figure's hands
- Same color as her powers
- Figure turns, disappears

What Ahdia thinks:
- Hallucinating from exhaustion?
- Someone following her?
- Doesn't pursue, too tired

**Do NOT include:**
- Figure speaking
- Ahdia recognizing the figure
- Any explanation

---

## CONSTRAINTS

1. **Geneva = Bellatrix clone:** Ahdia does NOT know this. No hints, no EM recognition. She learns way later.
2. **Korede/Leta thanks scene:** SKIP. Not in this chapter.
3. **Mystery figure dialogue:** CUT. Pure visual mystery only.
4. **Scene 5 POV:** Kain narrator, not Ahdia. Voice shifts completely.

---

## TOUCHPOINTS

**Scene 1 Start:** Go Squad on unofficial security detail, wrong threat model
**Scene 1 End:** Geneva's head explodes mid-sentence

**Scene 2 Start:** Chaos, stampede, Ahdia's decision
**Scene 2 End:** Kain framing narrative on live TV

**Scene 3:** CUT - Ben's findings folded into Scene 4 verbal report

**Scene 4 Start:** Team regroup, processing shock
**Scene 4 End:** Mystery figure watching, Ahdia exhausted

**Scene 5 Start:** Kain in private, mask off
**Scene 5 End:** Treatment dependency as weapon revealed

---

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before finalizing each scene:

- [ ] No Geneva = Bellatrix hints
- [ ] Mystery figure is visual only (no dialogue)
- [ ] Ahdia's depletion visible (nosebleeds, exhaustion, short freeze)
