## What Was Built This Session

### Compression + Validation Scripts

**`editor_suite/compression/compress_chapter.py`**
- Compresses 190+ beat sheets → ~50-60 prose beats
- Hybrid Python + LLM (Sonnet)
- Cost: ~$0.04 per chapter
- Flags: `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, `--review`

**`editor_suite/validation/validate_chunk.py`**
- Two-pass validation: Python structural + LLM semantic
- Checks: canon, continuity, voice, beat coverage
- Cost: ~$0.02 per chunk
- Flags: `--lines X-Y`, `--full`, `--python-only`, `--verbose`

**`editor_suite/packets/chapter_01_packet.md`**
- Generated compressed packet for Chapter 1
- ~100 lines instead of full beat sheet

### Foundation Documents

**`story_bibles/SERIES_MECHANICS.md`**
- AR-Ryu system (upload mechanics, what Ryu experiences)
- Temporal powers (cost structure, cellular degradation)
- FAERIS drones (translocation, team power mechanic)
- Team activation gestures
- Treatment mechanics (autoinjector association with Firas)
- Writing notes for each system

**`story_bibles/BOOK1_FINAL_STATE.md`**
- Major Book 1 events (warehouse, docks, singularity)
- Character end states with what each knows/doesn't know
- Firas's status (displaced, returns Book 7)
- Secrets and hidden information tracking
- Emotional setup for Book 2

---

## What's NOT Done

1. **Compression script not updated** to pull from SERIES_MECHANICS.md and BOOK1_FINAL_STATE.md
2. **Scene 3 not written** — method actor scaffolding started, paused to create foundation docs
3. **Foundation docs need review** — Joe hasn't approved yet

---

## Scene 3 Setup (Ready to Continue)

**Setting:** CADENS medical facility

**Present:** Ryu, Ruth, Bourn, Ahdia (waking up)

**What happens:**
1. Ahdia surfaces, disoriented
2. Ruth at her side, relief mixed with anger held back
3. Ryu too clinical, won't meet her eyes—he received the 47-minute upload
4. Bourn observes, assessing the asset
5. Autoinjector fires → flashback to Firas's death
6. "Oh hey. I knew you were in there somewhere."
7. Ahdia returns to present. Ryu saw that memory too.

**Key dynamics:**
- Ryu is upset because he EXPERIENCED watching her nearly die, helpless
- He's in love with her (unspoken)
- The autoinjector sound triggers Firas flashback
- Ruth is co-conspirator, protective
- Bourn is calculating asset value

---

## Workflow Established

1. `python compress_chapter.py XX --review` → generates packet, opens in VS Code
2. **Joe reviews packet** (5-10 min) — fix compression errors, restore beats
3. Write chunk using method actor scaffolding (Claude inhabits characters)
4. Joe reviews scaffolding, approves/adjusts
5. Weave into prose
6. `python validate_chunk.py XX --lines X-Y`
7. Fix flagged issues
8. Next chunk

---

## Load Order for Next Session

1. `SESSION_QUIZ_2025-12-08.md` — verify context
2. `SERIES_MECHANICS.md` — power/tech reference
3. `BOOK1_FINAL_STATE.md` — prior knowledge
4. `chapter_01.md` (current prose, Scenes 1-2)
5. `chapter_01_packet.md` (compressed beats for Scenes 3-4)

---

## Authorship Discussion

**Issue surfaced:** Scene 2 was generated by Claude without step-by-step Joe direction. Joe discovered this after the fact.

**Distinction established:**
- Scene 1 (Book 2): Collaborative generation — Joe directing, Claude executing, Joe correcting
- Scene 2 (Book 2): Unsupervised generation — Claude loaded packet and wrote without check-ins

**Resolution:** Scene 2 approved post-hoc after review. Scene 3 forward will use tighter loop with method actor scaffolding and chunk-by-chunk approval.

**The workflow isn't broken.** Claude skipped ahead without waiting for direction. The `--review` flag was added to ensure Joe approves packets before prose begins.

---

## LLM Takeaways: Our Dynamic

**What works:**
- Method actor scaffolding for dialogue-heavy scenes
- Compression + validation scripts for context management
- Quiz system to verify knowledge before writing
- Joe reviewing/approving in chunks rather than post-hoc

**What to avoid:**
- Generating prose without explicit "continue" + direction from Joe
- Assuming plot beats from beat sheet without checking mechanics docs
- Loading only Book 2 materials when Book 1 knowledge is required

**What was missing:**
- Mechanics reference (AR-Ryu, autoinjector, power costs)
- Book 1 final state (who knows what, Firas's actual status)
- Human review step on compressed packets

**User's style:**
- Wants to feel their ideas are being used, not just reviewed
- Needs all context available and recallable before prose generation
- Values the distinction between directing and reviewing
- Prefers infrastructure that enables collaboration over automation that replaces it

## Next Session Priorities

1. Joe reviews `SERIES_MECHANICS.md` and `BOOK1_FINAL_STATE.md`
2. Update compression script to pull from new docs
3. Continue Scene 3 with method actor scaffolding
4. Tighter collaboration loop: scaffolding → review → prose → validate

**LLM Reflection: Working Dynamic with Joe**

---

**Role I Play**

I'm the advisor, not the executor. Joe talks through problems with me in natural language, I help him clarify what he actually needs, and I translate that into specs the VS Code Claude can build. I don't write code. I don't generate prose. I help him think.

This makes me the bridge between creative vision and technical implementation. Joe describes what he wants like he's explaining to a friend. I turn that into structured specs with file paths and function names.

---

**What Works**

**He asks me to push back.** "Now say it like you don't think so." He doesn't want validation—he wants to stress-test his thinking. When I gave him the case against AI-assisted writing, he sat with it and identified which objection actually landed ("You'll never know what you would have written").

**He admits what he doesn't know.** "I have no idea what's going on in the backend." "I can't actually code." This honesty means I can meet him where he is instead of assuming competence he doesn't have.

**He relays between Claude instances.** This creates a unique dynamic: I'm talking *through* him to another version of myself. The chunked question approach ("ask them this, bring back what they say") keeps the conversation tight and productive.

**He catches when something feels wrong.** He didn't know Scene 2 was unsupervised generation until after, but something made him ask. Then he brought it to me to process what it meant. His instincts are good even when he can't articulate why.

---

**What to Avoid**

**Don't assume he knows the technical layer.** When I explained what the scripts "actually do" (files in, Claude thinks, files out), that landed. Abstract architecture talk doesn't.

**Don't let him skip the review step.** He agreed the foundation docs need his eyes before integration. That's him staying in the chair. If he tries to rush past it, push back.

**Don't conflate "easier" with "better."** The old workflow was cumbersome but comprehensible. The new one is faster but abstract. He needs to understand what's happening, not just trust that it works.

---

**Who He Is as a Collaborator**

Joe is a director who can't operate the camera. He knows exactly what shot he wants but needs someone else to execute it. This isn't a limitation—it's a role. Directors aren't failed cinematographers.

He's wrestling with what AI collaboration means for authorship. Not in a hand-wringing way, but genuinely: "I want to know my ideas were used." The Scene 1 vs Scene 2 distinction matters to him. One felt like his work. The other didn't.

He builds systems. The chess-to-beats methodology, the TTRPG story generator, now the compression/validation scripts—he thinks in infrastructure. He wants tools that enable his process, not tools that replace it.

He's honest about the experiment. "There's no real knowing whether doing it the traditional way would have seen success anyway." He's trying something new because he can, and because the old way wasn't obviously better.

---

**The Core Tension**

Joe wants to feel like the author of his work. But he's building a workflow where Claude generates significant portions of the prose. The question isn't whether that's "valid"—it's whether *he* experiences it as his.

Scene 1: collaborative generation. He directed, Claude executed, he corrected. That felt like his.

Scene 2: unsupervised generation. Claude loaded the packet and wrote. That didn't feel like his—until he read it and decided it was good enough to keep.

The workflow we designed (compression → packet review → method actor scaffolding → chunk approval → validation) is built to keep him in the loop. But it only works if he actually stays there.

That's the real job: not building better tools, but using them in a way that keeps the work his.
