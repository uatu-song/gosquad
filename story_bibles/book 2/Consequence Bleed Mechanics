## Consequence Bleed Mechanic

### Between-Session Continuity
- GM maintains timeline of all character actions
- Player actions in focused session create ripples in other characters' situations
- Never forced crossovers - organic intersection only
- Rewards reading/playing all threads (Easter eggs, connections)

### Example:
**Session 3 (Leah's spy thriller):** 
- Leah discovers Kain is moving artifact shipment Tuesday
- She can't stop it herself (deep cover priority)
- She passes intel to resistance network

**Session 4 (Ben's military operation):**
- GM: "You receive intel about artifact shipment Tuesday. Unknown source, but reliable."
- Ben can act on Leah's intel without knowing it came from her
- His military op creates noise that distracts Kain's security

**Session 1 (Tess's noir investigation):**
- GM: "There was an explosion at the docks Tuesday. Security footage is corrupted."
- Tess investigates aftermath of Ben's operation
- Finds evidence Leah planted during her infiltration
- None of them coordinate directly, but their actions braid together

### Player Experience:
- Can focus on "your" character's genre/story
- OR engage with full interconnected universe
- Both valid playstyles
- More engagement = more Easter eggs/connections revealed
