# CHAPTER 13: [Title TBD] (Month 5)

**Timing:** Month 5, evening
**Setting:** Ahdia's penthouse (team gathering)
**Present:** Go Squad minus Ahdia (notably absent)
**Theme:** "Near miss" - all puzzle pieces visible but not connected
**Tone:** Casual, social, domestic - relaxed guard makes the near-miss organic

---

## SETUP: The Penthouse

**Context:**
- Month 5, team gathering at Ahdia's place
- Ahdia absent (again) - secret mission
- Team using penthouse as informal base/hangout spot
- Leah basically living there (Ahdia letting her stay)
- Ahdia funding team expenses (gear, equipment, probably rent)
- Benevolent dictator pattern: Solving problems without being present

**Revelations Through Setting:**
- Expensive penthouse (Ahdia's wealth visible)
- Leah's stuff in guest room (she's been here weeks/months)
- Go Squad gear stashed in closet (tactical vests, comms, medical supplies)
- Fridge stocked, bills paid, but Ahdia never here
- Ghost presence: Helping from distance, not connecting

---

## BEAT 1-25: Arrival and Setup

1. Evening, team arriving at penthouse one by one
2. Ruth arriving first (has key, checking on place)

11. Ben: "Traveling where?" Leah: "Didn't say. Never does."
12. Team accepting Ahdia's absence as normal now (concerning normalization)
13. Tess sprawled on expensive couch: "This place is ridiculous. Who needs this much space?"
14. Leta: "Someone who's never here." Pointed but not malicious
15. Victor unpacking food, distributing containers
16. Ruth: "We should talk about the gear situation. We're running low on medical supplies."
17. Ben: "Ahdia said she'd handle expenses. Has she been?"
18. Leah: "Yeah, she left a card. Said use it for team stuff."
19. Ruth: "That's... generous. But weird she's not here to discuss it."
20. Victor: "Benevolent dictator energy. Provides resources, doesn't collaborate."
21. Tess: "She's grieving Firas still. Give her time."
22. Ruth: "It's been months. We're worried."
23. Leah: "Should we... I don't know, stage an intervention?"
24. Ben: "Hard to intervene on someone who's never around."

54. Tess: "No!" Ben: "Yes! Had to go back and pretend I was 'looking for the bathroom.'"
55. Leta: "Did they buy it?" Ben: "One woman asked if I'd tried doors instead of walls."
56. **TESS'S STORY:**
57. Tess: "Alright, I'll go. But this is classified."
58. Leta: "Nothing you say is classified." Tess: "This should be."
59. Tess: "Month 1, trying to impress everyone with parkour."
60. Tess: "Big dramatic rooftop entrance. Flip off fire escape, land in crouch."
61. Tess: "Except I landed in pigeon poop. Fresh. Slipped."
62. Tess: "Full split. Groin pull. Had to be carried off rooftop."
63. Leta: "By who?" Tess: "Victor. Fireman carry. Most embarrassing moment of my life."
64. Victor: "She kept apologizing." Tess: "I was COVERED in pigeon shit, Victor!"
65. Leta: "How have you never told me this?" Tess: "BECAUSE IT'S MORTIFYING."
66. **VICTOR'S STORY:**
67. Victor: "My turn to suffer. Month 3, community meeting."
68. Victor: "Presenting research to thirty organizers. Powerpoint, data, very professional."
69. Leah: "What happened?" Victor: "Didn't realize Leah had used laptop before me."
70. Victor: "Hit space bar. Screen fills with—"
71. Leah: "NO. NO NO NO." Victor: "—her Spotify playlist."
72. Victor: "Title: 'Songs to Cry to While Researching Atrocities.'"

81. Tess: "I brought flowers." Leta: "I was deep in conspiracy boards."
82. Leta: "She touches my shoulder. I scream. Throw laptop."
83. Leta: "Laptop hits wall, battery explodes—not badly, just pops out."
84. Leta: "I tackle her. Full defensive combat mode."
85. Tess: "She had me in arm bar before recognizing me."
86. Leta: "I THOUGHT YOU WERE A HARASSMENT THREAT."
87. Tess: "I had FLOWERS." Leta: "Harassers could have flowers!"
88. Ruth: "Did the laptop survive?" Leta: "Barely. Data survived. Relationship survived."
89. Tess: "I don't surprise her anymore."
90. **LEAH'S STORY:**
91. Everyone looking at Leah: "Your turn."
92. Leah: "I'm new—" Victor: "Nope. Story. Now."
93. Leah: "...Fine. Last month, trying to fit in."
94. Leah: "You all speak in code. Nicknames, references, inside jokes."
95. Leah: "Someone says 'tank situation.' I assume military thing."
96. Ben: "Oh no." Leah: "I spend TEN MINUTES explaining tank specifications."
97. Leah: "Armor thickness, cannon types, urban warfare tactics."
98. Ruth: "What were they actually talking about?" Leah: "Fish tank. For Ruth's apartment."
99. Ruth: "You explained anti-tank missiles when I asked about goldfish."
100. Leah: "I THOUGHT YOU WERE SPEAKING METAPHORICALLY."
101. Victor: "That's very white of you." Leah: "I KNOW. I'm aware."
102. Tess: "Did you at least learn about fish?" Leah: "I researched koi for six hours."
103. **THE AHDIA STORY:**
104. Laughter dying down, comfortable silence
105. Tess: "What about Ahdia? Anyone got Ahdia stories?"
106. Ruth: "She doesn't embarrass. Just vanishes when things get awkward."
107. Ben: "Remember warehouse incident? She just... froze time and left."
108. Leta: "That's the most Ahdia thing ever. 'This is uncomfortable, bye forever.'"
109. Victor: "She bought this penthouse to avoid living with people."
110. Leah: "And then offered it to me when I needed space. Ironic."
111. Ruth: "She's generous from a distance. Never up close."
112. Moment of team recognizing pattern together
113. Tess: "Should we be worried?" Ruth: "We are worried."
114. Ben: "But what do we do? She's never here to intervene on."
115. Conversation getting heavier, mood shifting

## BEAT 116-150: Leah's Living Situation (Transitional)

116. Leta noticing Leah's laptop, books spread on coffee table
117. Leta: "You basically live here now, huh?"
118. Leah slightly defensive: "Ahdia offered. My place was... not safe."
119. Tess: "Harassment?" Leah nodding
120. Leah: "After I got involved with organizing, stuff escalated."
121. Victor: "Same tactics we've seen targeting other activists."
122. Leta: "Bot networks, doxing attempts, coordinated campaigns?"
123. Leah: "Yeah. How'd you know?" Leta: "Because I'm researching it."
124. Leta explaining her investigation: Professional harassment as political weapon
125. Ben interested: "You're tracking the networks? Finding patterns?"
126. Leta: "Marketing firms, bot armies, deepfakes. All coordinated."
127. Ben: "Who's funding it?" Leta: "Still tracing. Corporate money, shell companies."
128. Leah: "Victor's been teaching me to document everything. Evidence chain."
129. Victor: "She's a quick study. Methodical."
130. Ruth: "This is good. We should coordinate our investigations."
131. Ben: "Agreed. I'm working on something similar with riot financing."
132. Victor: "And I'm seeing mining operations destroy communities I organize with."
133. Tess: "Everyone's investigating something except me. I'm just... processing."
134. Leta: "You're dealing with trauma. That's work too."
135. Tess: "Isaiah Bennett. My dad won't tell me anything about the case."
136. Team silent, supportive, respecting her pain
137. Leah changing subject gently: "Victor, tell them about the mining stuff."
138. Victor: "Communities poisoned, groundwater contaminated, cancer clusters."
139. Victor: "Company's rushing extraction. Rare earth minerals, I think."
140. Ben: "Rare earths? That's expensive. What are they building?"

## BEAT 141-170: The Near Miss (First Pass)

141. Victor: "No idea. But the urgency is weird. Normally mining is slow."
52. Ben: "I've seen rare earth purchases in financial records I'm tracking."
53. Ruth: "From your riot investigation?" Ben: "Yeah. Shell company buying reactor components."
54. Victor: "Reactor? Like nuclear?" Ben: "Fusion, actually. Kain's campaign promise."
55. Leah: "The American Energy Independence thing? That's real?"
56. Ben: "Very real. Fusion facility in the Southwest. Rushed timeline, cutting corners."
57. Victor: "Cutting corners like... environmental protections waived?"
58. Ben: "Exactly. Permits fast-tracked, EPA pressured."
59. Victor: "That would explain the mining urgency. Need materials for the reactor."
60. Leah: "So Kain's building an artificial sun by destroying communities?"
61. Ben: "Irony, right? Clean energy built on environmental devastation."
62. Victor: "Both/and. Good technology, horrific implementation."
63. **[DRAMATIC IRONY: Pattern visible to reader, team close to connecting]**
64. Leta: "Who's financing the reactor?"
65. Ben: "Shell company network. I've been mapping it. TRIOMF."
66. **[FIRST NAME DROP - but context shifts before anyone reacts]**
67. Tess's phone buzzing, looking at screen, expression darkening
68. Tess: "Shit. My dad's calling. Third time today."
69. Leta: "You still not talking to him?"
70. Tess: "After he stonewalled me about Isaiah Bennett? No."
71. Ruth: "He won't tell you anything about the case?"
72. Tess: "Says it's classified. National security. Bullshit."
73. Victor: "He's protecting someone." Tess: "Yeah. Not me."
74. Ben: "If you need CADENS access for investigation, I can try channels."
75. Tess: "Would you? I need to know what really happened. Who gave the orders."
76. Ben: "I'll see what I can find. Might take time."
77. **[MOMENT INTERRUPTED - conversation moving away from TRIOMF]**
78. Leah: "More wine?" General agreement, getting up to refill glasses
79. Victor: "I'll help." Following Leah to kitchen
80. Moment passed, near-miss complete (first pass)

## BEAT 171-200: Kitchen Sidebar (Victor & Leah)

171. Kitchen, Victor and Leah opening wine bottles
82. Leah quietly: "Thank you. For the rides, the mentoring, letting me crash meetings."
83. Victor: "You're doing the work. I'm just connecting you to the right people."
84. Leah: "It's more than that. You've been patient with me."
85. Victor: "Growth takes time. You're further along than you think."
86. Leah: "I still say the wrong thing constantly. Center myself, miss the point."
87. Victor: "But you catch it faster now. Apologize quicker. That's progress."
88. Leah: "Is it enough?" Victor: "Enough for what?"
89. Leah: "To be useful. To actually help."
90. Victor: "You're here. You're learning. You're staying uncomfortable. That's the work."
91. Leah: "I'm researching something else. Haven't told the team yet."
92. Victor: "What?" Leah hesitating
93. Leah: "Kain's treatment of women. NDAs, settlements, pattern of abuse."
94. Victor: "That's important. Why not share?"
95. Leah: "It's personal. The red dress thing... he harassed me. I recorded it."
96. Victor: "You have audio of Kain sexually harassing you?"
97. Leah: "Yeah. And I've found 15-20 other women. NDAs, payoffs."
98. Victor: "That's explosive. Why sit on it?"
99. Leah: "Timing. If I release now, it gets lost in news cycle. Need strategic moment."
100. Victor: "You're thinking like an organizer. Good."
101. Leah: "But it's hard. Carrying this alone. Processing what he did to me."
102. Victor: "You don't have to process alone. Team would support you."
103. Leah: "I know. But I need to finish the investigation first. Build comprehensive case."
104. Victor: "Your call. But don't wait so long you burn out."
105. Leah: "When's the right time? When does it matter most?"
106. Victor: "Close to election. After other scandals, when media's watching."
107. Leah: "So I'm sitting on evidence while he campaigns?"
108. Victor: "You're building a case that can't be dismissed. That's strategic, not cowardice."
109. Leah: "Okay. I trust you."
110. Returning to living room with wine

## BEAT 201-235: Living Room Conversation (The Near Miss - Second Pass)

201. Rejoining group, Ruth mid-story about surgery rotation disaster
112. Everyone laughing, wine flowing, guard completely down
113. Tess: "Ruth, how do you stay so calm under pressure?"
114. Ruth: "Triage thinking. Assess, prioritize, accept losses."
115. Ben: "Military trains the same way. Save who you can, move on."
116. Leta: "That's dark." Ruth: "It's realistic. Trying to save everyone means saving no one."
117. Leah: "Is that how you lead the team? Triage?"
118. Ruth: "Sometimes. Like tonight - everyone's working separate investigations."
119. Ruth: "Can't coordinate everything. Trust you're doing good work independently."
120. Ben: "Speaking of - Leta, you mentioned marketing firms earlier. Which ones?"
121. Leta: "Astroturf operations, mostly. One's called Synergy Solutions."
122. **[SECOND NAME DROP - shell company in TRIOMF network]**
123. Ben: "Synergy... that sounds familiar. Is it a subsidiary?"
124. Leta: "Yeah, parent company is... hold on, I have notes."
125. **[MOMENT WHERE CONNECTION COULD HAPPEN - but interruption]**
126. Tess standing abruptly: "I need air. Balcony?"
127. Leta: "You okay?" Tess: "Yeah, just... thinking about Isaiah Bennett again."
128. Leta following Tess to balcony, comforting girlfriend
129. **[CONVERSATION DERAILED - second near-miss]**
130. Victor to remaining group: "She's struggling. We should support her more."
131. Ruth: "Hard when we don't know details. If Ben can find information..."
132. Ben: "I'm trying. CADENS security is tight around the Bennett case."
133. Leah: "Bennett case?" Ben: "Isaiah Bennett. Environmental engineer killed by police months ago."
134. Leah: "That's what the protests were about. Tess is investigating that?"
135. Ruth: "Chief Whitford was involved. Tess is trying to find out what he knew."
136. Leah: "Her father won't tell her?" Victor: "Protecting someone. Or something."
137. Ben: "Pattern I've seen before. Whistleblowers disappeared, records scrubbed."
138. Ben: "Isaiah Bennett knew too much about... something. Police killed him."
139. Victor: "Your riot investigation?" Ben: "Maybe. Or the fusion project."
140. **[THIRD NEAR-MISS - pieces almost connecting]**
141. Leah: "Would Kain order a police killing of a whistleblower?"
142. Ben: "He's killed dozens through agent provocateurs. Direct police killing? Possible."
143. Victor: "If Bennett knew about environmental crimes, safety violations..."
144. Ben: "He'd be eliminated. Can't risk exposure during campaign."
145. Ruth: "So Isaiah Bennett might have been trying to expose Kain?"

## BEAT 236-265: Balcony Scene (Tess & Leta)

236. Balcony, city lights, Tess leaning on railing
147. Leta joining her, arm around waist
148. Leta: "Talk to me."
149. Tess: "Isaiah Bennett was innocent. I know he was."
150. Leta: "I know you do." Tess: "Everyone does. That's why we protested."
151. Tess: "But my father stonewalls. Won't give me anything."
152. Leta: "You're using his connection to investigate?"
153. Tess: "Trying. He's Chief of Police. He knows what happened."
154. Leta: "And he won't tell you?" Tess: "Because he's complicit."
155. Tess: "Isaiah was killed by police. My father's police."
156. Leta: "That's not your fault."
157. Tess: "He's my father. I'm using his name, his position to investigate."
158. Leta: "That's brave. You're trying to expose the truth."
159. Tess: "It feels like betrayal. Of him. Of the badge I used to respect."
160. Leta: "You're not betraying anything. You're choosing justice."
161. Tess: "Isaiah had a family. People who loved him. And he's gone."
162. Silence, city noise below
163. Leta: "What do you need? How can I help?"
164. Tess: "Help me find evidence. Anything to prove what happened."
165. Leta: "Ben's looking." Tess: "It's not enough. I need more."
166. Leta: "Why the urgency?" Tess: "Because every day my father walks free is another day Isaiah's family waits for justice."
167. Leta: "We'll get there. I promise."
168. Leta: "Come back inside. Be with the team."
169. Tess: "In a minute." Leta: "I'll wait."
170. Both standing together, letting moment breathe
171. Tess: "Do you think I'm doing the right thing? Investigating my own father?"
172. Leta: "I think you're brave. That's what matters."
173. Tess: "Even if it destroys my family?"
174. Leta: "Your father destroyed it. Not you."
175. Eventually returning inside, hands linked

## BEAT 266-300: The Near Miss (Final Pass)

266. Group reconvening, Tess and Leta returning from balcony
177. Conversation shifted to lighter topics (intentionally avoiding heavy)
178. Victor telling story about organizing disaster (activist drama)
179. Everyone laughing, tension broken
180. Ben's phone buzzing, checking message
181. Ben: "Huh. Financial alert on my investigation."
182. Ruth: "What?" Ben: "TRIOMF moved money. Big transfer."
183. **[THIRD MENTION OF TITAN STRATEGIC - still no one connects]**
184. Leah: "TRIOMF? I've seen that name."
185. **[SO CLOSE - but memory doesn't click]**
186. Ben: "It's the shell company funding the riots. And the fusion reactor."
187. Victor: "Wait, the mining operations too?"
188. Ben: "Maybe? What's the company name?" Victor: "Hold on..."
189. Victor pulling up notes on phone, searching
190. **[MOMENT OF POTENTIAL CONNECTION - but phone call interrupts]**
191. Ruth's phone ringing, urgent tone, doctor emergency

195. Ruth gathering things, rushing out
196. **[CONVERGENCE MOMENT INTERRUPTED - fourth near-miss]**
197. Ben: "I should go too. Early morning surveillance."
198. Tess: "Yeah, we should head out. Leta's got work."
199. Party breaking up, everyone leaving
200. Victor: "Leah, you staying here?" Leah: "Yeah. Ahdia's place."
201. Victor: "Okay. Lock up. Be safe."
202. Leah: "I will. Thanks for everything."
203. Everyone departing, leaving Leah alone in penthouse
204. Leah cleaning up takeout containers, wine glasses
205. Noticing everyone's investigation notes left on coffee table
206. Ben's financial documents: "TRIOMF"
207. Leta's harassment research: "Synergy Solutions (TRIOMF subsidiary)"
208. Victor's mining notes: "Titan Mining Corp (rare earths)"
209. **[ALL THE PIECES PHYSICALLY PRESENT - but Leah doesn't synthesize]**
210. Leah too tired, putting notes in neat stack, heading to guest room

## BEAT 301-320: Leah Alone (Ending)

301. Guest room, Leah's temporary space
212. Laptop open, her own investigation files
213. Kain's NDA database, survivor testimonies, audio recording
214. Political donation records showing... TRIOMF funding
215. **[LEAH HAS THE FINAL PIECE - but doesn't realize]**
216. Too focused on abuse pattern, not seeing financial network
217. Leah researching late into night, separate track
218. Not connecting her investigation to team's investigations
219. Each thread separate in her mind
220. Closing laptop eventually, exhausted
221. Lying in guest bed, Ahdia's penthouse quiet
222. Leah thinking: "Ahdia pays for all this. Where is she getting money?"
223. Never here but funds everything, solves problems from distance
224. Benevolent dictator pattern visible but normalized
225. Leah falling asleep, surrounded by puzzle pieces
226. Window showing city lights, Caledonia at night
227. Somewhere Kain campaigning, fusion reactor construction continuing
228. Somewhere Ahdia on secret mission, exhausted, treatment-dependent
229. Somewhere all the threads converging
230. But not tonight. Not yet.

## CHAPTER SUMMARY

### Dramatic Function

**"Near Miss" Structure:**
- Every piece of the puzzle physically present
- Multiple opportunities for connection
- Each time, natural interruption or shift
- Maximizes dramatic irony without feeling forced

**Why It Works:**
- Social setting makes guard down (organic)
- Multiple investigations mentioned naturally
- Interruptions realistic (calls, emotional moments, people leaving)
- Reader frustrated (in good way) - knows what characters don't
- Makes Month 6 convergence more satisfying (finally!)

### Information Revealed

**Ahdia's Absence:**
- Not just missing missions, absent from life
- Funding team (gear, penthouse access, Leah's housing)
- Benevolent dictator pattern clear
- Team worried but normalizing her absence

**Leah's Living Situation:**
- Staying at penthouse (Ahdia's generosity)
- Harassment escalated, needed safe space
- Victor mentoring consistently
- Growth visible but slow

**Investigation Updates:**
- Ben: TRIOMF = riots + fusion project
- Leta: Bot networks, Synergy Solutions subsidiary
- Victor: Mining operations, rare earth extraction
- Leah: Kain's abuse pattern, NDAs, audio recording (private)

**TRIOMF Name Drops:**
1. Ben mentions it (riot/fusion financing)
2. Leta mentions Synergy Solutions (subsidiary)
3. Victor almost connects mining company
4. **Pattern there but not synthesized**

### Character Moments

**Tess/Leta:**
- Tess investigating Isaiah Bennett's murder by police
- Using father's (Chief Whitford) connection despite ethical conflict
- Leta supportive, patient
- Relationship strong despite strain

**Victor/Leah:**
- Kitchen sidebar reveals Leah's secret investigation
- Victor affirming her growth
- Strategic timing discussion (when to leak audio)
- Mentor/student dynamic deepening

**Ruth:**
- Team leader role visible
- Triage thinking applied to leadership
- Emergency call shows divided attention
- Absent when connection could happen (ironic)

**Ben:**
- Investigation advanced (tracking Titan money movements)
- Willing to help Tess find answers
- Missing connections because focused on financial trail

### Thematic Integration

**"Near Miss" As Metaphor:**
- Team capable but circumstances prevent synthesis
- Doing everything right individually
- System too complex for heroic comprehension
- Reflects larger Book 2 theme: Perfect work still insufficient

**Benevolent Dictator:**
- Ahdia absent but controlling
- Provides resources without collaboration
- Team dependent but she's not present
- Pattern escalating unchecked

**Both/And:**
- Grateful for Ahdia's support AND worried about her
- Leah growing AND still centered on herself
- Investigations progressing AND missing connections
- Social gathering AND work discussion

### Setup for Chapter 14 (Month 6 Convergence)

**What Changes:**
- Team meeting specifically to coordinate investigations
- Everyone in "work mode" not social mode
- Ruth pushing for synthesis
- Ben says "Wait, you said TRIOMF?" and everything clicks
- Dramatic payoff after Chapter 13's frustrating near-misses

**Foreshadowing:**
- Leah has audio that will matter (Month 11)
- Tess's investigation of Isaiah Bennett will reveal connections to TRIOMF
- Chief Whitford's stonewalling protecting conspiracy
- Ahdia's absence will cause crisis

---

## STATUS

**Chapter 13 Complete:**
- 320 beats across multiple scenes
- Social/domestic chapter (casual setting)
- "Near miss" structure (dramatic irony peak)
- All puzzle pieces present but not connected
- Character development through downtime

**Integration with Book 2:**
- Month 5 (between Chapter 12 investigation deepening and Month 6 convergence)
- Penthouse established as recurring location
- Ahdia's financial support revealed
- Leah's living situation clarified
