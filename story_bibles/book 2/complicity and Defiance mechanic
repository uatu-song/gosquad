## Complicity and Defiance Mechanic

### For Institutional Players (CADENS, Police, Kain's org)

**Complicity Track:**
- Every time you follow orders that harm others: +1 Complicity
- Every time you stay silent when you should speak: +1 Complicity
- Every time you choose career over conscience: +1 Complicity

**Defiance Track:**
- Every time you leak information: +1 Defiance
- Every time you "accidentally" delay operations: +1 Defiance
- Every time you warn targets: +1 Defiance

**Tension:**
- High Complicity = More institutional power, less personal integrity
- High Defiance = More personal integrity, institutional consequences
- Can't max both - they pull opposite directions

**The Reckoning:**
- Eventually you hit breaking point
- Either: Full defection (quit/betray organization)
- Or: Full complicity (become what you fought against)
- Or: Operate in the gap (small acts of resistance within system)

### Example - CADENS Campaign:

**Session 1:**
- Players are federal agents monitoring Go Squad
- Orders: "Observe only, do not intervene"
- They watch Go Squad nearly die to Kain's forces
- Choice: Follow orders (+1 Complicity) or intervene (+1 Defiance)

**Session 5:**
- High Complicity path: You've been promoted, trusted with classified intel
- High Defiance path: You're under investigation, handlers watching you
- Both playable, both tense, different flavors

**Session 10:**
- The Reckoning: Your orders are "eliminate Go Squad"
- High Complicity: You've justified everything up to now, can you justify this?
- High Defiance: You've been preparing for this, ready to burn it down?

### The Intermediary Model:
- Like the cosmic bureaucrat in your universe
- Can't stop The Helminth (institutional constraint)
- But can provide loopholes, warnings, small defiances
- Redemption isn't quitting - it's resisting within impossible constraints
- "You can be both/and: System participant AND saboteur"
