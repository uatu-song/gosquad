## Answers

1. **TRIOMF** (NOT "Cadens" or "CADENS" alone—CADENS is part of TRIOMF)

2. **Isaiah Bennett** (pre-Book 2, referenced in Chapter 1) and **Leta Owolowo** (Chapter 21). **NO, Tess does NOT kill Webb**—she brutalizes him in Chapter 23 but leaves him alive. This is a critical canon constraint.

3. (a) **90%**, (b) **52%** (after the major baseline burn), (c) **0.7%** (near death, Ruth saves her)

4. **Before Book 2**—his death is what the Chapter 1 memorial protest is about. He is NOT killed during the book.

5. **He loves Ahdia**—watches her when he thinks she isn't looking, finds reasons to be near her, but never confesses or acts on it.

6. Ruth discovers **Ahdia's actual baseline decline numbers** (that Ryu has been hiding). Ryu is forced to reveal the severity. This causes trust damage—Ruth realizes Ahdia has been self-destructing and hiding it.

7. **"'But' creates hierarchy. 'And' holds both truths."** This is Victor's both/and teaching that he gives to Leah and applies throughout Book 2.

8. **Fear resistance practice**—distinguishing justified fear from Eidolon-amplified distortion. She teaches this through Victor's community networks.

9. **"conserving"** — Full line: "What the hell am I conserving?" This shows his faith collapse in the institutions he believed in.

10. Leah's awakening arc moves too slowly—by the time she speaks up against the harassment (Chapter 18), **Leta is already dead** (Chapter 21). Her growth came "too late" to help the person who most needed white allies to speak up. Leta even told her directly: "Your silence hurts."

11. **Success**: Ahdia's control-based approach lets her function under cosmic horror, regulate herself, and do hero work. **Failure**: It becomes self-destruction through toxic productivity. She "regulates" herself into burning 90% of her lifespan in 12 months. The approach works for survival but fails because she uses it to justify self-sacrifice rather than accepting support. True resolution comes in Book 5 with acceptance, not control.

12. **Victor's community networks save the team during the Chapter 21 manhunt.** When thousands of citizens are hunting the team, it's not their powers that save them—it's safe houses, escape routes, and regular people hiding vigilantes from the mob. Everything Victor built over 12 months pays off in that moment.

13. **[AS CHARACTER_NAME]** for character voice, **[NARRATOR]** for narrator voice. Characters speak in first person, narrator in third person.

14. **Scaffolding, not final prose**—the method actor system generates rough scene structure with character moments that then gets refined into polished prose. It's for discovering what characters would actually do/say, not for publication-ready text.

15. **The symbiosis:** Ahdia creates a **temporal bubble/field** (time dilation, not full freeze) around each team member. **FAERIS executes within that bubble**—the drones provide the actual effect (translocation, force amplification, velocity multiplication, trajectory extension). Each use costs Ahdia cellular degradation/lifespan. The team's "powers" are Ahdia's temporal manipulation + FAERIS amplification working together.

16. **Activation triggers:**
    - **Tess (Gloom Girl):** Middle finger raised + eye-tracking where she looks → translocation
    - **Ben (Night Knight):** Crouch in athletic stance + jump → trajectory amplification (super-jump)
    - **Leah (Battlea):** Battle cry vocalization + forward momentum → velocity multiplication (super-speed)
    - **Victor (Crimson Sable):** Specific hand position (grabbing gesture) + grasping motion → force amplification (super-strength)

17. **Penthouse**—Ahdia watches via feeds from her penthouse, NOT on rooftop with team. This is a prose decision that overrides the beat sheet (prose is canon, beat sheet is scaffolding).

18. **Victor (d20=10 partial success):** Saves elderly woman and teenager, directs them to alley. Then fights 4 cops using Krav Maga—redirects first cop's baton swing, elbows second cop in ribs, but third cop flanks and hits his shoulder, fourth cop boots him in chest. Goes down fighting, phone skitters away, feed goes dark. Comms lost but vitals show he's alive (HR 112).
