# Book 2A Continuity Tracker

**Endpoint:** Chapter 19 - Ruth discovers Exile Island
**Timeline:** Month 1 → Month 6-7

---

## THE MAZE AT A GLANCE

This is a tragedy engine with many moving parts. Here's the inventory:

### Active Threads (Must Track)

| Thread | Seeds Planted | Blooms | Payoff |
|--------|---------------|--------|--------|
| **Ahdia's baseline** | Ch 1 (95%) | Continuous | Ch 17 (54%), Ch 19 (~50%) |
| **Benevolent dictator arc** | Ch 3 (Ryu intel) | Ch 7-16 (global ops) | Ch 19 (Exile Island) |
| **Ruth's institutional capture** | Ch 4 (Bourn meeting) | Ch 10-16 | Ch 17-18 (boundaries) |
| **Eidolon phases** | Ch 4-5 (Subtle) | Ch 10-16 (Escalation) | Ch 17+ (Critical) |
| **Resistance practice** | Ch 3 (Both/And) | Ch 10 (but/and) | Election (60% effective) |
| **Leta harassment→death** | Ch 6 (3 accounts) | Month 5-7 | Month 11 (killed) |
| **Ben's faith→breakdown** | Ch 6 (Sarah grief) | Month 8 (evidence fails) | Book 2B |
| **Tess vigilante arc** | Ch 5 (Webb walks) | Month 11 (Leta dies) | Post-election (brutalizes Webb) |
| **Leah's silence** | Ch 10 (learns but/and) | Month 5-7 (doesn't speak) | Month 9 (too late) |
| **Webb countdown** | Ch 5 (exonerated) | — | Month 11 (kills Leta) |
| **Prime watching** | Ch 5 (rooftop) | — | Book 2B (reveals herself) |

### The Undercurrent

**"Why didn't you save her?"** - Present in every chapter, never spoken aloud.

### Key Numbers

- Ahdia baseline: 95% → 54% (Ch 17) → ~50% (Ch 19) → <10% (Book 2B end)
- Treatment gap: 11 days = death
- Eidolon resistance: 60-70% effective (insufficient)
- Kain polling: +8 → +12 → dips → recovers → **wins**

### Relationship Reminders

- Victor + Leah = **lovers** (not mentor)
- Bourn = **Harriet** (woman)
- Tess + Leta = partners
- Ruth + Firas = he was going to propose

### Open Mystery Threads

| Mystery | What Team Thinks | What's Actually True | Resolved? |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Geneva's shooter** | Kain's operation (follows bot network trail) | Unknown—NOT Bellatrix, NOT necessarily Kain | No |
| **Bot network** | Connected to shooter | Separate operation—Kain's infrastructure, exploited the assassination | Partially (Titan Strategic in Month 6) |
| **Translocation tech** | CADENS-level, points to insider | Unknown source | No |

**Key distinction:** The bot network and the assassination are NOT the same operation. Bots = Kain's infrastructure (always running, exploits any crisis). Shooter = unknown (military precision, translocation tech, motive unclear).

## "WHY DIDN'T YOU SAVE HER?" TRACKER

The question no one asks aloud. The undercurrent.

| Character | Their Version | When It Surfaces |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| Ahdia | "I have time powers and couldn't save Geneva" | Ch 3 (to Ryu) |
| Ahdia | "I was in Jakarta while my team got attacked" | Ch 5 (internal) |
| Ruth | "I couldn't save Firas" | Ch 3 (grief scene) |
| Ruth | "I can't save Ahdia from herself" | Ch 17-18 |
| Ben | "I was across town when Sarah died" | Ch 6 |
| Ben | "Perfect evidence couldn't save the election" | Month 8 |
| Tess | "I warned Leta and it wasn't enough" | Month 11 |
| Leah | "I stayed silent while Leta was harassed" | Month 9 |
| Victor | "I taught resistance and it only works 60%" | Election night |

## EIDOLON PHASE TRACKING

**Source:** `/story_bibles/book 2/Eidolon_Antagonist_Design.md`

### Phase Progression

| Phase | Chapters | Manifestation | Ahdia Experience |
|-------|----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Subtle** | Ch 1-9 | Ambient presence, minor amplification | Attributes to normal depression |
| **Escalation** | Ch 10-16 | Targeted attacks, team notices pattern | Missing missions, powers failing |
| **Critical** | Ch 17-19+ | Major failures, complete retreats | Days unable to leave apartment |

### What's Been Seeded (Ch 3-6)

| Element | Status | Chapter | Notes |
|---------|--------|---------|-------|
| Eidolon named | ✓ | Ch 5 | Bourn names entity at CADENS |
| Fear amplification shown | ✓ | Ch 4, 5 | Victor attacked, mob attack |
| EM signature detection | ✓ | Ch 5 | FAERIS detects anomaly |
| Ahdia's absence pattern | ✓ | Ch 5, 6 | "Treatment ran long" excuse |
| Ahdia's freeze/avoidance | Partial | Ch 3 | On couch, distant—needs visceral paralysis scene |
| Leta develops counter | ✗ | — | Needs seeding in organizing scenes |
| Victor Both/And teaching | ✓ | Ch 3 | "Grieve AND lead"—not yet linked to Eidolon |
| Resistance practice | ✗ | — | Ch 10 plants but/and, needs explicit connection |
| Bellatrix connection | ✗ | — | Hidden until Book 3+ |

### Still Needed

1. **Ahdia paralysis scene** - Show her unable to leave apartment, not just absent
2. **Leta notices "too big" anger** - At a protest, realizes something external
3. **Victor links Both/And to Eidolon** - Teaching becomes resistance practice
4. **Powers failing** - Ahdia's time freeze disrupted by fear (Escalation phase)
5. **Team frustration** - "Where were you?" becomes pattern

### Resistance Practice Seeding

| Character | Learns From | When | Effectiveness |
|-----------|-------------|------|---------------|
| Victor | Own grief work | Pre-Book 2 | High (teaches others) |
| Leta | Notices pattern at protests | Ch 7-9? | High (develops practice) |
| Leah | Victor (Ch 10) | Month 2 | Moderate (fails when it matters) |
| Ahdia | Leta/Victor | Month 6-7 | 60-70% by end |
| General public | Organizing networks | Months 8-11 | Insufficient (Kain wins) |

### The Counter Mechanic

**Justified Fear vs Distorted Fear (DBT "Check the Facts"):**
1. Identify emotion (fear)
2. Check if proportional to actual threat
3. If justified → channel into action
4. If distorted → recognize manipulation, don't act on it

**Key insight:** Eidolon can't distort fear that's already aimed correctly

---

## CONSISTENCY CHECKS

### Numbers to Track
- Ahdia's baseline (decreasing ~2-3% per chapter during ops)
- Days without treatment = 11 (death threshold)
- Treatment extends 18-24 months (not cure)
- Eidolon resistance: 60-70% effective (insufficient)
- Kain polling: +8 → +12 (assassination) → dips → recovers → wins

### Location Consistency
- Ahdia's penthouse = Go Squad HQ
- Leah moves in Month 5-6
- CADENS facility = treatment location (or house calls)

### Relationship Consistency
- Victor + Leah = lovers (not mentor/student)
- Tess + Leta = partners (secret from Korede initially)
- Ruth was with Firas (he was going to propose)
- Bourn = woman (Harriet)

## METHOD ACTOR SCAFFOLDS COMPLETED

- [x] Chapter 3

- Ch 17: Ruth/Ahdia confrontation (emotional climax)
- Ch 19: Ruth/Ryu discover Exile Island (Both/And complexity)
