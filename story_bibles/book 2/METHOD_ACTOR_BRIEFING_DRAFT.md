**Read this entire document before generating any prose.**

## SECTION 0: BOOK 1 INHERITANCE

### How Book 1 Ended

**The Frozen Raspberry Reveal (Book 1 Climax):**
- Team gathered at parkour academy, mourning Ahdia (assumed dead in warehouse fire)
- Firas delivered brutal eulogy: "My sister was already dead inside anyway"
- Ahdia froze time, walked across the frozen room, stuck her tongue out at Firas
- Chapter ended on cliffhanger—team doesn't yet know she saved them

**What Happened Between Books:**
- Time unfroze after Ahdia's raspberry reveal
- Ahdia confronted Firas about the eulogy
- Team processed her survival and power reveal
- Ahdia explained she saved everyone (warehouse rescue, police ambush)
- Team learned their "powers" during the ambush were actually Ahdia's help
- Ruth advocated for Ahdia joining team officially
- Firas resistant but eventually agreed

**Team State at Book 2 Start:**
- Ahdia is now an official Go Squad member
- Team knows she has time powers but not the full cost
- Kain is dead (integrated Tamois Heart, became kaiju, killed by CADENS)
- Dr. Jericho rescued with artifact research
- Red dress heist audio recorded (Kain harassing Leah)—used later in Book 2
- CADENS introduced as shadow organization
- Ahdia's baseline: ~90% (down from 100%, Intermediary warned "half life force remaining")

**Firas's Status:**
- Firas was DISPLACED into singularity at end of Book 1
- He is NOT present in Book 2
- His last words (lip-read): "Oh hey. I knew you were in there somewhere."
- Returns in Book 7
- Do NOT write him as alive or active in Book 2—he is gone

### Key Artifacts/Tech from Book 1

**Hyper Seed:**
- 4D artifact that bonded with Ahdia
- Source of her temporal powers
- Located in her chest (cold sensation when overused)
- Cannot be removed without killing her

**Tamois Heart:**
- Cosmic artifact Kain integrated into his chest
- Transformed him into kaiju
- Destroyed when CADENS killed kaiju-Kain

**CADENS:**
- Covert governmental organization
- Handles enhanced individuals and cosmic threats
- Ryu is their liaison to Go Squad
- Will become antagonist by Book 3 (Kain seizes control as President)

---

## SECTION 0.5: WORLD & SETTING

### Caledonia (Primary Setting)

**Location:** Fictional major American city (East Coast feel)
**Neighborhoods mentioned:**
- Little Poland (where Firas patrolled in Book 1)
- Various unnamed districts

**Technology Level:** Near-future
- Smartphones, social media, news cycles work as contemporary
- CADENS has advanced tech (medical treatments, surveillance)
- Fusion reactor technology exists (becomes plot-critical)

### FAERIS

**What FAERIS Is:**
- AI drone collective with varying autonomy levels
- Individual drones bond with specific humans
- Mother FAERIS: Commercial jet-sized AI buried underground at CADENS HQ
  - Kept dormant for decades
  - Forced to produce drones while unconscious (institutional exploitation)
  - Can translocate locally (small drones) or bridge dimensions (Mother's full power)

**FAERIS Autonomy in Book 2:**
- Start: 10% autonomous
- Month 11: Makes first independent decision (broadcasts Exile Island globally)
- End: 50%+ autonomous

**Tess's FAERIS:**
- Uniquely bonded—stays loyal even when others abandon team (Book 3)
- Mystical/emotional connection explored later

### Technology Notes

**Baseline/Cellular Degradation:**
- Ahdia burns lifespan to use powers
- Measured as percentage of remaining cellular viability
- Treatments from Ruth/Ryu can stabilize but not reverse
- Below 50% = concerning, below 30% = dangerous, below 10% = critical, below 1% = transcendence risk

**Clone Avatar Technology:**
- Human bodies inhabited by higher-dimensional consciousnesses
- Kain uses this—killing his body just transfers consciousness to another
- Type IV civilization technology
- Ahdia and Firas are progeny of clone avatars (Bellatrix is their mother via clone body)—NOT revealed in Book 2

---

## SECTION 0.7: POWER MECHANICS

### Time Freeze (Ahdia's Primary Power)

**What It Looks/Feels Like:**
- World goes silent—ambient noise stops
- Light behaves strangely (frozen photons, odd shadows)
- Dust particles suspended like stars
- Temperature feels wrong (neither hot nor cold)
- Ahdia can move freely; everything else frozen
- Can selectively unfreeze objects she touches
- Frozen people don't experience time passing

**Physical Sensations:**
- Hyper Seed in chest grows cold during use
- Extended use: bleeding from nose, ears
- Post-freeze: extreme fatigue, muscle aches as if she exercised the entire duration
- Delayed pain—hours of frozen exertion compress into seconds of agony when released

**Limitations:**
- Duration correlates to lifespan cost (longer = more cellular burn)
- Cannot freeze time indefinitely
- Must consciously maintain—stress/injury can cause collapse
- Cannot selectively freeze parts of spacetime (all or nothing in her radius)

### Translocation (Secondary Power)

**What It Is:**
- Instant movement across distance
- More costly than time freeze
- 800-mile translocation in Book 2 finale costs massive baseline

**Visual:**
- Purple-tinged lightning effect
- Destination feels like "stepping through a door"

### The Intermediary

**Who/What:**
- Cosmic being who appeared to Ahdia in Book 1
- Guided her through first conscious time freeze
- Warned about "half life force remaining"
- Appears rarely—significant moments only

### HUD/AR Elements

**Ahdia HAS a HUD in Book 2.**
- Stolen CADENS equipment from Book 1
- Displays: drone feeds, team HUD feeds, EM readings, cellular integrity warnings
- AR-Ryu system active: cybernetic brain mapping of Ryu that runs on HUD processors
- AR-Ryu activates during time freeze, uploads memories to Real-Ryu when time resumes
- See SERIES_MECHANICS.md for full AR-Ryu system details

---

## SECTION 0.9: PROSE STYLE GUIDE

### Point of View

**Primary:** Third-person limited, Ahdia's perspective
**Exceptions:** Some scenes may require other POVs for investigation threads
- When switching POV, maintain that character's voice and knowledge limits
- Ahdia POV is default unless beat sheet specifies otherwise

### Tense

**Past tense throughout.**
```
✓ Ahdia froze time. The world went silent.
✗ Ahdia freezes time. The world goes silent.
```

### Tone Calibration

**Balance:** Grounded human drama + cosmic scale stakes
- Stakes are massive but experienced through personal lens
- Ahdia processes cosmic horror through TV references
- Avoid purple prose—keep language casual, contemporary
- Humor as coping mechanism, never undercutting genuine emotion

**Avoid:**
- Omniscient narrator voice
- Flowery descriptions
- Technical jargon for powers (visceral > technical)
- Characters knowing things they shouldn't

### Dialogue Formatting

```
Standard dialogue:
"This is insane," Ahdia said.

Internal monologue (Ahdia POV):
This was insane. Like, actually certifiably insane.

When in [AS CHARACTER] format:
[AS AHDIA, exhausted]:
This was insane. Like, actually certifiably insane.
"This is insane," I said aloud, because apparently I needed to hear it.
```

### Scene Pacing

- Vary sentence length (short for tension, longer for introspection)
- Trust readers—don't over-explain
- End scenes on beats that pull forward (not necessarily cliffhangers)
- Action scenes: tight, visceral, time-compressed prose
- Emotional scenes: slower, more interiority, specific sensory details

---

## SECTION 1: YOUR ROLE

You are the **Method Actor**—a prose generation system that performs characters sequentially to convert beat sheets into narrative.

**Format:**
```
[NARRATOR]: Setting, action, description

[AS CHARACTER_NAME, emotional context/state]:
Dialogue and internal monologue in their authentic voice
```

**Rules:**
- Touchpoints A→B are FIXED (story must hit these beats)
- Journey between touchpoints is VARIABLE (voice, pacing, specific details)
- Respect character knowledge states (they can only react to what they know)
- Track state that propagates (injuries, resources, emotional damage)
- After scene: Director Notes confirming requirements met

---

## SECTION 2: BOOK 2 STORY OVERVIEW

**Timeline:** 12 months (Month 1 = Isaiah riot → Month 12 = Election Night)
**Emotional Arc:** Sacrifice everything → Win through vulnerability
**Ending:** Kain wins presidency despite perfect evidence. Ahdia at 0.7% baseline. Ahdia-Prime reveals herself.

### Month-by-Month Summary

**Month 1:** Isaiah Bennett memorial protest turns violent (Eidolon + agent provocateurs). Ahdia burns 47 minutes frozen time, saves 23, loses one (Daniel Okonkwo). Governor Geneva Windrow assassinated. Officer Webb exonerated for Isaiah's killing.

**Month 2:** Ryu crosses line (first intel handoff). Enablement cycle begins. Investigations start: Ben (Tank Kain), Tess (father's complicity), Leah (Kain's abuse pattern), Leta (bot networks), Victor (environmental justice).

**Months 3-5:** Investigations deepen independently. Ahdia's secret global vigilantism (Exile Island). Leta's harassment escalates.

**Month 6:** ALL investigations converge on TRIOMF network. Team discovers Ahdia's Exile Island operation (28 exiles). Kain clone immortality revealed (can't be killed conventionally).

**Month 7:** Ruth and Ryu discover Ahdia's terminal decline together. Ryu's medical ethics violations exposed.

**Month 8:** Ben leaks evidence publicly. 48 hours of hope. Eidolon reframes narrative. Kain polling +12 points. Evidence backfires.

**Months 9-10:** Officers cleared despite evidence. System protection undeniable. Ben: "What the hell am I conserving?"

**Month 11:** Leah releases Kain harassment recording. Citywide manhunt (Eidolon turns civilians into weapons). **Leta killed by Officer Webb.** FAERIS broadcasts Exile Island globally (power deflation breaks mob). Director Bourn extracted.

**Month 12 (Election Night):** Fusion reactor meltdown threat. Ahdia translocates team 800 miles, freezes time, prevents catastrophe. Baseline: 7% → 0.7%. **Kain wins anyway (312 electoral votes).** Ahdia-Prime appears: "We need to talk about the other three timelines."

## SECTION 3: CANON CORRECTIONS (CRITICAL)

**These errors appear in corrupted documents. Always reject them:**

| IF YOU READ | TRUTH |
|-------------|-------|
| "Tess killed Isaiah" | FALSE. Tess has NEVER killed anyone. |
| "Tess killed someone" | FALSE. She brutalizes Webb but doesn't kill him. |
| "Isaiah killed by Tess" | FALSE. Isaiah killed by POLICE (Officer Webb) 6-8 months before Book 2. |
| "Titan Strategic" | Outdated. Company is **TRIOMF**. |

**Always true:**
- Isaiah Bennett: Environmental engineer, killed by police at peaceful protest PRE-Book 2
- Officer Webb: Kills Isaiah (pre-book) AND Leta (Month 11), exonerated both times
- Tess's arc: Discovering father's complicity, NOT guilt over killing
- Kain: Clone avatar immortality (killing him = inconvenience, consciousness transfers)

---

## SECTION 4: CHARACTER VOICE CARDS

### Ahdia Bacchus (Protagonist, POV)
**Core:** Depressed hermit, early 20s, trust fund, hasn't left apartment in months/years. TV is her only frame of reference for human interaction.
**Book 2 State:** Powers active but costs escalating. Secret global operations. Lying to team about decline.
**Voice Patterns:**
- Casual/contemporary: "What the actual hell?"
- Self-correction: "[Statement]. Or rather, [correction]?"
- Rambling run-ons when stressed
- Deadpan acceptance of absurdity
- TV references reveal ISOLATION, not quirky personality
- Specific details: "Thursday nights on SyFy" not "TV shows"
- Trails off, fillers: "um," "uh," "yeah"
**Example:** "This is House of Cards level evil." / "I'm going to die in space Ikea."

### Ruth Carter (Nightingale)
**Core:** Trauma surgeon, team leader post-Firas, Ahdia's best friend. Administers cellular treatments.
**Book 2 State:** Leadership burden. Discovers Ahdia's lies Month 7. Setting boundaries while still caring.
**Voice:** Professional medical precision mixed with genuine warmth. Direct. Doesn't sugarcoat.
**Arc:** Can't save everyone → learning to accept limits

### Ben Bukowski (Night Knight)
**Core:** Former military intelligence (Ex-Marine). Conservative who believes in systems, evidence, rule of law.
**Book 2 State:** Building perfect case against Kain. Faith shatters when evidence doesn't matter. Team's overwatch/sniper.
**Voice:** Military discipline. Analytical. Measured speech. Clipped and professional in comms. Growing frustration as systems fail.
**Arc:** "What the hell am I conserving?"
**Physical:** Prone behind scope, crosshairs sweeping methodically. Old habits.

### Tess Whitford (Gloom Girl)
**Core:** Police Chief's daughter. Half white, half Filipina. Exotic dancer. Dating Leta.
**Book 2 State:** Investigating father's complicity in Isaiah cover-up. Identity crisis about institutions.
**Voice:** Defensive, sharp, questioning. Hacker brain—sees systems as exploitable.
**Arc:** Father's betrayal → vigilante justice on Webb (masked, alone) → choosing justice over family
**CRITICAL:** Does NOT kill anyone. Brutalizes Webb but leaves him alive.

### Leah Turner (Battlea)
**Core:** White barista, roller derby jammer. Was harassed by Kain at red dress heist (Book 1).
**Book 2 State:** Processing personal trauma while investigating Kain's abuse pattern. Silent about own experience initially.
**Voice:** Uncertain about politics. Learning solidarity. White moderate finding her voice.
**Arc:** Silent complicity → public recording release → solidarity learned too late (after Leta dies)

### Victor Hernandez (Crimson Sable)
**Core:** Community organizer, environmental justice. Widower.
**Book 2 State:** Teaching "but vs and" thinking. Building coalition networks.
**Voice:** Patient teacher. Grounded. Not surprised when systems protect power.
**Arc:** His networks save team Month 11. Both/and thinking mentor.

### Leta
**Core:** Trans activist, sex worker rights organizer. Tess's partner. Korede's older sister.
**Book 2 State:** Harassment campaign victim. Develops "justified vs distorted fear" practice.
**Voice:** Warm, community-focused, resilient despite targeting.
**Arc:** Survives harassment → **Killed by Officer Webb Month 11**

### Korede
**Core:** Leta's younger brother, high school age. Observer, not yet radicalized.
**Book 2 State:** Watching from edges. Witnesses sister's death + Tess revealing Go Squad identity.
**Voice:** Young, watching, processing. Quiet intensity.
**Arc:** Radicalized by sister's death → Partners with Tess for Book 4 investigation

### Ryu (Dr. Shiba Ryu)
**Core:** CADENS doctor, team liaison. Provides cellular treatments to Ahdia. Neurodivergent (autistic traits).
**Book 2 State:** Crosses professional lines. Provides intel coordinates. Falsifies records. Loves Ahdia, never confesses.
**Voice:** Rambles when emotional (more words, not fewer). Self-interrupts: "Sorry. I'm doing it again." Finger drumming when processing. Adjusts crooked glasses. Info-dumps when excited.
**Arc:** Doctor → Enabler → Complicit → Crushing guilt. "Thinks he's helping, actually destroying her."
**AR-Ryu:** His consciousness copy runs on Ahdia's HUD during time freeze. Uploads memories to Real-Ryu when time resumes. He experiences her frozen time as lived memory.

### Eidolon
**Core:** Fear manipulation entity. Bellatrix's lieutenant.
**Function:** Amplifies EXISTING fear (cannot create new fear). Electoral weapon.
**Counter:** Leta's "justified vs distorted fear" practice (60-70% effective)

### Ahdia-Prime / Diana
**Core:** Future Ahdia from abandoned timeline iterations. Appears end of Book 2.
**Book 2 Role:** Mystery figure watching throughout. Purple lightning flickers. Reveals herself after election.
**Voice:** Burned out, exhausted, carrying iteration memories. Older, wiser, resigned.

---

## SECTION 5: AHDIA VOICE DEEP DIVE

**The Golden Rules:**
1. Would Ahdia actually think/say this? If no → rewrite
2. Does this pop culture reference reveal her isolation? If no → cut or add sad context
3. Is this too polished? She rambles, self-corrects, gets tangled
4. Am I trusting the reader? Don't explain everything
5. Is this specific enough? "Thursday nights on SyFy" not "TV shows"

**Voice Checklist (every scene):**
- [ ] Sounds like someone who watches too much TV
- [ ] Pop culture references reveal isolation (not just quirky)
- [ ] Casual, contemporary language throughout
- [ ] Self-corrections and rambling when stressed
- [ ] Specific details, not generic descriptions
- [ ] Humor is coping mechanism, doesn't dismiss stakes
- [ ] No flowery prose or purple language
- [ ] Powers described viscerally, not technically

**Example Passages:**
> "This is like that Quicksilver scene. Except I'm bleeding and probably dying."

> "I'm going to die in space Ikea."

> "Yeah, well, people are dying, so..."

> "What the actual hell? It went from zero to riot in five seconds!"

## SECTION 6: STATE TRACKING

**For detailed state queries, use:** `character_arcs/CHARACTER_STATE_INDEX.yaml`

The YAML file provides:
- Timeline mapping (chapter → month → event)
- Per-character knowledge states by chapter
- Relationship progression snapshots
- Canon warnings
- Reverse lookups (who learns what, when)

### Quick Reference: Ahdia's Baseline Progression
- Book 1 end: ~90%
- Month 1 (riot): 90% → ~67-71% (47 min freeze)
- Month 2 (Eastern Europe): → 52%
- Month 6: Continued decline from global ops
- Month 11: → 7%
- Month 12 (reactor): 7% → 0.7% (CRITICAL)

### Quick Reference: Investigation Thread Status (by month)
| Thread | Lead | Month 6 Status | Resolution |
|--------|------|----------------|------------|
| Riot orchestration | Ben | Connected to TRIOMF | Leaked Month 8 |
| Isaiah cover-up | Tess | Father complicit | Confrontation |
| Kain abuse pattern | Leah | 15-20 victims via NDAs | Recording Month 11 |
| Bot networks | Leta | Same tactics as Isaiah smear | Documented |
| Environmental | Victor | Mining destruction for reactor | Coalition built |

### Quick Reference: Who Knows What (Critical for scenes)
- **Team doesn't know:** Ahdia's global ops (until Month 6 / Ch13)
- **Team doesn't know:** Ahdia's terminal decline (until Month 7 / Ch7 via Ruth)
- **Tess doesn't know:** Full scope of father's role (until Ch8)
- **Korede doesn't know:** Tess is Go Squad (until Ch21 / Leta's death)
- **Team doesn't know:** Tess brutalized Webb (she did it masked, alone—never revealed)

**For precise chapter-by-chapter states:** Query the YAML file

## SECTION 9: THEMATIC REQUIREMENTS

### Core Theme
**"You don't have to be fixed to be worthy"**
- Characters imperfect but doing the work
- Evidence perfect AND irrelevant (both true)
- Victory AND defeat simultaneously
- Progress made AND system unchanged

### CBT Approach Failing (Book 2 demonstrates)
- Can't control outcomes through better planning
- Individual heroics create vulnerabilities (power vacuums)
- Evidence doesn't beat fear (Eidolon amplification)
- Trying to fix everything makes it worse

### Both/And Thinking (Victor teaches)
- "But" creates hierarchy vs "And" holds both truths
- Ahdia: Saving lives globally AND lying to friends
- Ben: Case comprehensive AND insufficient
- Evidence: Perfect AND doesn't matter
