# CHAPTER 6: Rest and Recovery (Month 1)

**Timing:** Month 1, evening after mob attack (two days after Chapter 5)
**Theme:** How the team processes trauma in downtime - lovers, family, grief
**Tone:** Domestic, intimate, grounded - showing civilian lives amid superhero chaos

---

## SCENE 1: Tess/Leta/Korede - Coming Home

**Setting:** Tess and Leta's apartment, downtown Caledonia. Modest 1-bedroom, organizing materials everywhere, community space vibe.
**Present:** Tess (just home from day shift at club), Leta (been home organizing), Korede (arrives mid-scene)

### Beat 1-10: Tess Arrives Home (Shedding Work Persona)

1. Tess unlocks apartment door, 7 PM, still in civilian clothes from club
2. Not costume—day shift dress code is "cocktail formal" (professional, not sexualized)
3. Heels off immediately at door, relief visible
4. **Tess (calling out):** "I'm home. Please tell me you ate actual food today."
5. Apartment: Small but lived-in, organizing posters on walls, mutual aid flyers, community defense materials
6. Kitchen table covered in paperwork: Trans rights petitions, sex worker advocacy documents
7. **Leta (from couch, laptop open):** "Define 'actual food.'"
8. **Tess (walking to kitchen):** "Something that wasn't a granola bar while typing angry emails."
9. **Leta:** "Then no. But I made coffee, which is a vegetable."
10. **Tess (deadpan):** "Coffee beans are seeds. You're thinking of tomatoes."

### Beat 11-20: Domestic Intimacy (Relationship Established)

11. Tess in kitchen, checking fridge: leftovers from three days ago, condiments, energy drinks
12. **Tess:** "Okay, so we're ordering in. What are you feeling?"
13. **Leta (not looking up from laptop):** "Whatever. I'm not hungry."
14. **Tess (knowing better):** "You're ALWAYS hungry. You're just hyperfocused."
15. **Leta (finally looking up):** "Fine. Thai. The place with the good papaya salad."
16. Tess pulls out phone, orders their usual (she has it memorized)
17. **Tess:** "ETA 30 minutes. Which gives you time to tell me about whatever made you forget to eat."
18. **Leta (slight smile):** "That obvious?"
19. **Tess (coming to couch, sitting near Leta's feet):** "Babe, you do this every time you're onto something."
20. **Leta (closing laptop halfway):** "Okay, so, you know the coalition meeting last week?"

### Beat 21-32: Organizing Work (Partnership, Not Just Romance)

21. **Leta explaining:** Sex worker rights coalition connecting with trans advocacy networks
22. Overlap obvious: Many trans women do sex work (survival, discrimination, few options)
23. **Leta:** "We're building mutual aid infrastructure. Support systems that don't involve cops."
24. **Tess (listening, feet in Leta's lap now):** "Community defense stuff?"
25. **Leta:** "Yeah. De-escalation training, safe house network, legal support that doesn't out people."
26. **Tess:** "You're doing the thing where you take on too much again."
27. **Leta (defensive):** "It's important—"
28. **Tess:** "I know it's important. I'm saying you don't have to do it alone."
29. **Leta (softer):** "I'm not alone. Korede's been helping with outreach."
30. **Tess (concerned):** "Your baby brother? He's what, seventeen?"
31. **Leta:** "Eighteen in two months. And he WANTS to help."
32. **Tess:** "Just... be careful what you're exposing him to, yeah?"

### Beat 33-45: The Balance (Tess's Protective Instincts, Not Overbearing Yet)

33. **Leta (reading Tess's tone):** "You're worried."
34. **Tess:** "I'm always worried. It's kind of my thing."
35. **Leta:** "This is safer than a lot of what I've done. We're just organizing."
36. **Tess (investigator brain):** "Organizing scares power. You know that."
37. **Leta:** "So what, I should stop? Stay quiet?"
38. **Tess (quickly):** "No. God, no. You're... you're amazing at this."
39. **Tess (struggling with words):** "I just don't want you to get hurt."
40. **Leta (touching Tess's face):** "Hey. I know what I'm doing."
41. **Tess (leaning into touch):** "I know you do. Doesn't stop me from worrying."
42. **Leta:** "Good thing I'm not asking you to stop."
43. **Leta (gently):** "Just... trust me to know my own limits?"
44. **Tess (nodding):** "I'm working on it."
45. **Moment of quiet understanding between them**

### Beat 46-55: Tess's Day (Club Work, Reading People)

46. **Leta (shifting topic):** "How was work?"
47. **Tess (groan):** "Day shift is supposed to be chill. Supposed to be."
48. **Leta:** "What happened?"
49. **Tess:** "Bachelor party. At 2 PM. On a Wednesday."
50. **Leta (laughing):** "Oh no."
51. **Tess:** "Finance bros. Cocaine confident. Kept trying to negotiate 'extras.'"
52. **Tess (noir-comedy energy):** "I told one guy, 'This is a gentleman's club, not a brothel. And even if it was, you couldn't afford me.'"
53. **Leta:** "Did he back off?"
54. **Tess:** "Not until security explained the house rules. With his FACE."
55. **Leta (concerned despite laugh):** "You okay though?"

### Beat 56-68: Why Tess Works Day Shift (Character Detail)

56. **Tess:** "I'm fine. This is why I do days."
57. **Leta:** "Remind me?"
58. **Tess:** "Day shift: Businessmen on lunch breaks, retirees with disposable income, gentlemen who tip well and leave."
59. **Tess:** "Night shift: Bachelor parties, drunk 20-somethings, finance bros who think they own you."
60. **Leta:** "Strategic choice."
61. **Tess:** "Professional boundaries. Better clientele, safer environment."
62. **Tess (investigator showing):** "Plus day shift regulars? They talk. I learn things."
63. **Leta:** "Things?"
64. **Tess (shrug):** "City dynamics. Power structures. Who's sleeping with who, who's screwing over who."
65. **Tess:** "You'd be surprised what men admit when they think you're not really listening."
66. **Leta (impressed):** "You're gathering intel."
67. **Tess:** "I'm paying attention. It's different."
68. **Subtext:** Skills transfer from club to Go Squad investigation work

### Beat 69-80: Go Squad Life (Tess's Perspective on Enhanced Work)

69. **Leta:** "Speaking of paying attention—anything interesting with Go Squad?"
70. **Tess (considering what to share):** "Patrol went sideways yesterday. Mob attack."
71. **Leta (immediately concerned):** "Are you hurt?"
72. **Tess:** "Bruised. Nothing serious. We got out."
73. **Leta:** "Mob attack? What happened?"
74. **Tess:** "People got scared of us. Like, overnight. Same neighborhoods that waved last week."
75. **Tess (investigator brain engaged):** "Something's manipulating fear. Making people terrified."
76. **Leta (activist brain engaged):** "That's... that's a pretty effective control mechanism."
77. **Tess:** "Yeah. Make people afraid of the ones trying to help, they won't accept help."
78. **Leta:** "And then when things get worse, they're isolated and desperate."
79. **Tess:** "Exactly. Someone's playing a long game."
80. **Leta:** "Any idea who?"

### Beat 81-92: Korede Arrives (Family Dynamic)

81. **Tess:** "Not yet. But I'll figure it out."
82. **Leta (fondly):** "You always do."
83. **Tess:** "One of us has to be the detective."
84. **Leta:** "I thought I was the detective. You're the muscle."
85. **Tess (mock offense):** "Excuse you, I have investigative skills—"
86. **Leta:** "Babe, you literally punched a guy last week for grabbing Korede."
87. **Tess:** "That was TACTICAL muscle. Very different."
88. **Leta (laughing):** "Uh huh."
89. Key in door: Korede entering with backpack (straight from school or organizing work)
90. **Korede (17, male, Leta's younger brother):** "I heard punching. Are we talking about the guy at the rally?"
91. **Tess:** "Your sister's bringing up old news."
92. **Korede (grinning):** "It was last WEEK."

### Beat 93-110: Dinner Together (Family, Not Just Couple)

93. Doorbell: Food delivery actually arrived
94. **Korede:** "Thai? Yes. I'm starving."
95. **Leta:** "You're always starving. You're seventeen."
96. **Korede:** "Almost eighteen. And that's how aging works, yeah."
97. Tess distributes containers, three of them on couch/floor, comfortable chaos
98. **Tess:** "So how was school? Or organizing? Or wherever you were?"
99. **Korede:** "Rally planning meeting. We're organizing protest for next month."
100. **Leta (concerned):** "Korede, that's—"
101. **Korede:** "Important. Yeah, I know. You taught me that."
102. **Tess (watching sibling dynamic):** "Protest about what?"
103. **Korede:** "Kain's polling up. People are scared. We're making noise before election."
104. **Leta:** "Just... be safe, okay? Things are getting tense."
105. **Korede:** "I'm always safe. I learned from the best."
106. **Leta (torn between pride and protectiveness):** "That's not reassuring."
107. They eat, TV on mute (news coverage none of them want to watch)
108. **Comfortable family domesticity amidst chaos**
109. **Korede (mouth full):** "So Tess, Go Squad stuff still weird?"
110. **Tess:** "Define weird."

### Beat 111-125: The Undercurrent (Foreshadowing with Korede Present)

111. **Korede:** "Mob attacked you guys? Like, actual civilians?"
112. **Tess:** "Yeah. Got scared, got angry, got violent."
113. **Korede:** "That's... that's messed up."
114. **Tess:** "Someone's making people afraid. Weaponizing fear."
115. **Leta's phone buzzes on table, she glances, frowns slightly**
116. **Tess (noticing):** "What?"
117. **Leta:** "Nothing. Just... social media stuff."
118. **Korede (looking over):** "More nasty comments?"
119. **Tess (investigator instinct engaged):** "More?"
120. **Leta (dismissive):** "It's fine. Just trolls."
121. **Korede:** "Three new burner accounts today. I've been helping block them."
122. **Tess (sitting up):** "Three TODAY?"
123. **Leta (glaring at Korede):** "You weren't supposed to worry her."
124. **Korede (defensive):** "She should KNOW. It's getting coordinated."
125. **Tess:** "Show me. Now."

### Beat 119-130: Protective Instinct (Pre-Harassment, Early Warning)

119. **Tess (alarm bells):** "Three accounts this week targeting you specifically?"
120. **Leta:** "It's probably one person with too much time."
121. **Tess:** "Or one person MAKING time. That's coordinated harassment."
122. **Leta (trying to de-escalate Tess's worry):** "Babe, I've dealt with worse—"
123. **Tess:** "I know you have. That's not the point."
124. **Tess (investigator mode fully engaged):** "Can I see the accounts? Screenshots?"
125. **Leta (hesitant):** "I don't want you to go into overprotective mode—"
126. **Tess:** "I'm already there. Screenshots. Please."
127. **Leta (sighing, pulling up phone):** "Fine. But you're going to see nasty shit and I need you to not freak out."
128. **Tess (taking phone, scrolling):** "...okay, this is organized."
129. **Leta:** "It's three trolls—"
130. **Tess:** "Three accounts, same talking points, targeting your trans + sex worker intersection work specifically."

### Beat 131-142: Investigation Brain Meets Personal Fear

131. **Tess:** "This isn't random trolling. Someone's targeting your organizing."
132. **Leta (trying to stay calm):** "Activists get targeted. It's part of the work."
133. **Tess:** "That doesn't make it okay."
134. **Leta:** "I know. But I'm not stopping because some assholes discovered Twitter."
135. **Tess (torn between pride and fear):** "I'm not asking you to stop."
136. **Tess (struggling):** "I just... I need to know this is on my radar, okay?"
137. **Leta:** "Your radar?"
138. **Tess:** "Something feels off. The timing. Right when Go Squad's getting hit with fear manipulation?"
139. **Tess:** "Makes me wonder if targeting activists is part of larger pattern."
140. **Leta (hadn't connected this):** "You think they're related?"
141. **Tess (investigator instinct):** "I think someone's making people afraid. Of us. Of you. Of anyone who organizes."
142. **Tess:** "Fear is a weapon. And someone just armed up."

### Beat 143-155: The Promise (Love + Partnership)

143. **Leta (processing):** "Okay. So what do we do?"
144. **Tess:** "Document everything. Screenshots, timestamps, account names."
145. **Tess:** "Build a case. Pattern recognition. See if it escalates."
146. **Leta:** "And if it does?"
147. **Tess (honest):** "Then we deal with it. Together."
148. **Leta:** "Together?"
149. **Tess:** "You think I'm letting you handle coordinated harassment alone?"
150. **Leta (small smile):** "My knight in tactical muscle."
151. **Tess (deadpan):** "I will never live that down, will I?"
152. **Leta:** "Never."
153. They settle back into couch, food mostly eaten, TV still muted
154. **Tess's arm around Leta, Leta's head on Tess's shoulder**
155. **Comfortable, but both aware: Something's starting**

### Beat 156-165: Scene End (Quiet Before Storm)

156. **Leta (after long silence):** "Thank you for worrying about me."
157. **Tess:** "Can't help it. You're important."
158. **Leta:** "To the organizing?"
159. **Tess:** "To me."
160. **Leta (turning to look at Tess):** "You're important to me too."
161. **Tess:** "Even when I'm overprotective?"
162. **Leta:** "Especially then."
163. They kiss, gentle, domestic
164. **Leta:** "But seriously, if you start trying to bubble-wrap me..."
165. **Tess:** "I'll resist the urge. Probably."

### Beat 166-170: The Watch (External Threat Unknown)

166. **Camera pulls back: apartment window, visible from street**
167. **Someone outside, watching their building** (NOT Prime—different figure)
168. Phone in hand, taking photo of their window
169. **Uploading photo to social media with caption:** (we don't see exact text, but implication clear)
170. **The harassment is just beginning**

---

## SCENE SUMMARY

### Character Details Established

**Tess:**
- Day shift exotic dancer (strategic choice: better clientele, safer, intel gathering)
- Investigator instincts (reading people, pattern recognition, building cases)
- Protective of Leta (not overbearing yet, but seeds visible)
- Noir-comedy energy (deadpan humor masking genuine worry)
- Go Squad work contextualized (mob attack affected her)

**Leta:**
- Trans activist, sex worker rights organizing (intersectional focus)
- Community defense work (mutual aid, safe houses, de-escalation training)
- Independent, confident, knows her limits
- Korede's older sibling (protective of him, brings him into organizing)
- Dismisses early harassment (used to trolling, doesn't see pattern yet)

**Relationship Dynamic:**
- Domestic partners, organizing partners, comfortable together
- Tess protective, Leta independent (balance maintained)
- Both activists in different ways (street organizing vs tactical investigation)
- Mutual respect, gentle teasing, genuine care
- "Together" is their operating principle

### Foreshadowing Established

**Harassment Campaign (Months 5-7):**
- Three burner accounts this week (early stage, coordinated)
- Targeting trans + sex worker intersection specifically
- Timing suspicious (while Go Squad facing fear manipulation)
- Leta dismisses it (activists get targeted, she's dealt with worse)
- Tess recognizes pattern (investigator instinct engaged)

**Larger Pattern:**
- Fear as weapon (Go Squad facing it, activists facing it)
- Coordinated targeting (not random trolling)
- Escalation coming (both sense something starting)
- External figure watching (harassment organizing, not random)

### Thematic Function

**"You Don't Have to Be Fixed to Be Worthy":**
- Leta's activism despite being targeted (worthy while vulnerable)
- Tess's club work as legitimate profession (worthy despite stigma)
- Both navigating systems designed to exclude them (worthy despite marginalization)

**"Both/And Thinking":**
- Tess protective AND respects Leta's autonomy (both true)
- Leta independent AND accepts partnership (both true)
- Organizing important AND dangerous (both true)

**"CBT Approach Failing Preview":**
- Can't control harassment by being "good enough" activist
- Can't prevent targeting through perfect security
- Tess wants to protect Leta (control the outcome—won't work)

### Integration with Book 2 Arc

**Month 1 Context:**
- After Go Squad mob attack (Chapter 5 reference)
- Before major harassment (Months 5-7)
- Early warning signs (three burner accounts, pattern emerging)
- Eidolon's influence hinted (fear spreading, targeting activists)

**Leads Into:**
- Month 5-7: Harassment escalates (death threats, doxxing, vicious attacks)
- Tess becomes overprotective (strain on relationship)
- Leah's silence on Leta's harassment (white moderate arc)
- Community organizing continues despite targeting

### Noir-Comedy Tone Examples

- "Coffee beans are seeds. You're thinking of tomatoes."
- "That was TACTICAL muscle. Very different."
- "My knight in tactical muscle." / "I will never live that down, will I?"
- Deadpan delivery masking genuine fear
- Hannah Einbinder energy: Sharp wit as coping mechanism

### Domestic Details (Grounding)

- Heels off at door (physical relief from work)
- Ordering Thai food (they have "their usual")
- Organizing paperwork on kitchen table (work bleeds into home)
- Comfortable silence, legs tangled on couch
- TV on mute (neither wants to engage with news)
- Five minutes of peace (victory amidst chaos)

---

## SCENE 2: Ben - Coping with Loss

**Setting:** Ben's apartment, late night (same evening as Scene 1). Spartan, military-precise, too clean for someone living alone.
**Present:** Ben, alone
**Tone:** Grief, avoidance, work as coping mechanism failing

### Beat 1-12: The Apartment (Absence Made Visible)

1. Ben's apartment: Everything in its place, military precision
2. **TOO clean** - no lived-in mess, no personality, frozen in time
3. Kitchen: Single plate, single mug (was once two of everything)
4. Living room: Couch he doesn't sit on, TV he doesn't watch
5. **Her absence everywhere** - gaps where things used to be
6. Photos removed (too painful), but outline visible on walls (dust marks)
7. Ben in doorway, coming home from CADENS debrief
8. Still in tactical gear, hasn't changed yet
9. **Avoidance visible:** He stands in doorway, doesn't want to enter
10. This apartment isn't home. It's a reminder of who's missing.
11. **Ben (to empty apartment):** "Okay. I'm home."
12. **No one answers. No one's answered in eight months.**

### Beat 13-25: The Routine (Work as Avoidance)

13. Ben finally enters, drops gear by door (not usual military precision)
14. Straight to bedroom - not to sleep, to work
15. Desk covered in files: Kain investigation, Tank Kain massacre evidence
16. **This is what he does instead of grieving**
17. Opens laptop, pulls up surveillance footage
18. Cross-referencing Kain campaign events with riot locations
19. Building timeline, connecting dots, **losing himself in pattern recognition**
20. **Work is safer than remembering**
21. Clock shows 11 PM, he's been at this for three hours
22. Hasn't eaten dinner (wasn't hungry, forgot)
23. Coffee mug beside laptop, cold (from this morning)
24. **Ben's coping mechanism: Work until exhausted, sleep dreamlessly, repeat**
25. It worked for seven months. Starting to fail now.

### Beat 26-38: The Trigger (Random Memory)

26. Sorting through riot footage, civilian face catches his eye
27. **Woman, mid-30s, caught in mob panic**
28. Not significant to investigation, just background
29. But something about her expression - fear, confusion, trying to help someone
30. **Reminds him of Sarah** (his wife, we're learning her name now)
31. Same look she had that day (eight months ago)
32. **The memory he's been avoiding breaks through:**
33. Peaceful protest turned violent (agent provocateurs + Eidolon amplification)
34. Sarah was there (activist, community organizer, always at protests)
35. Tried to de-escalate, got caught in stampede
36. **Died helping someone else escape**
37. Ben was across town on Go Squad operation, couldn't save her
38. **Guilt he carries:** "I save strangers. Couldn't save her."

### Beat 39-52: The Break (Grief Surfaces)

39. Ben staring at woman in footage who isn't Sarah
40. **But could have been. Should have been. Wasn't.**
41. Laptop screen blurring (tears, unexpected)
42. **Ben (voice breaking):** "Fuck."
43. Tries to keep working, can't focus
44. **Eight months of avoidance cracking**
45. Gets up, paces (military precision falling apart)
46. Kitchen: Opens cabinet, sees Sarah's favorite tea still there
47. **Kept it. Can't use it. Can't throw it away.**
48. Mug she always used, collecting dust
49. **Ben touches mug, breaks down properly**
50. Not crying - **gasping, drowning, eight months of suppressed grief hitting at once**
51. Slides down cabinet, sitting on kitchen floor
52. **The work isn't working anymore. The avoidance failed.**

### Beat 53-66: The Truth He's Avoiding

53. **Internal:** He's not investigating Kain to get justice
54. **He's investigating to avoid feeling this**
55. If he works hard enough, builds case well enough, catches Kain...
56. ...maybe Sarah's death will have meaning
57. **Maybe it won't have been random, senseless, preventable**
58. But it WAS random. Agent provocateur could've hit any protest.
59. She was just there. Wrong place, wrong time.
60. **No cosmic significance. No grand narrative. Just gone.**
61. And Ben's conservative ideology: "System works if you work hard enough"
62. **System DIDN'T work. System killed his wife.**
63. But he can't process that yet (Book 2 won't break him, that's Book 4)
64. So he keeps investigating, keeps working, **keeps pretending work fixes grief**
65. **It doesn't. It never did.**
66. But it's all he knows how to do.

### Beat 67-80: The Photo (What He Lost)

67. Ben still on kitchen floor, grief subsiding to numbness
68. Pulls out wallet (military habit, always carries it)
69. Hidden compartment: **Photo of Sarah**
70. Not wedding photo (too formal). Candid shot, her laughing.
71. **That's what he misses most - her laugh**
72. She was funny, sharp, politically active
73. They disagreed on almost everything (he's conservative, she was activist)
74. **But they TALKED. Really talked. Challenged each other.**
75. Made him think about systems differently
76. **She was changing him slowly, without him realizing**
77. And then she was gone.
78. **And he's stuck - half-changed, half-conservative, fully broken**
79. Can't go back to who he was (she changed him too much)
80. Can't move forward (she's not there to show him how)

### Beat 81-94: The Realization (Work Won't Save Him)

81. Ben looking at photo, understanding hitting:
82. **Catching Kain won't bring her back**
83. Building perfect case won't make it meaningful
84. **Justice (if he gets it) won't fill the emptiness**
85. He knows this. Has known this for months.
86. **Keeps working anyway because it's better than feeling**
87. Better than admitting: She's gone and nothing fixes that
88. **Phone buzzes: Ruth checking in** (she does this, notices who's struggling)
89. Text: "You good? Haven't heard from you since debrief."
90. Ben types "I'm fine", deletes it
91. Types "Just working", deletes it
92. Types "Yeah, all good", deletes it
93. **Finally sends:** "Processing. Talk tomorrow?"
94. **Ruth:** "Yeah. I'm here if you need."

### Beat 95-108: The Choice (Keep Going or Break)

95. Ben sits on kitchen floor with Sarah's photo
96. Two options: Keep working until he passes out (usual method)
97. Or: Actually process grief (terrifying, unfamiliar)
98. **He's not ready for option 2**
99. Gets up slowly, puts photo back in wallet
100. Returns to desk, opens laptop
101. **Back to Kain investigation** (the familiar pain)
102. But something's different now:
103. **He knows it's avoidance. Knows it won't work.**
104. **Does it anyway because he doesn't know what else to do**
105. Work as coping mechanism = failing
106. **But it's the only coping mechanism he has**
107. So he keeps building the case, connecting dots, **pretending it matters**
108. **Screen reflects his face: Exhausted, broken, pretending to function**

### Beat 109-120: Scene End (Parallel to Tess/Leta/Korede)

109. **Split screen concept (if visual medium):**
110. **Ben alone at desk, working to avoid grief**
111. **Tess/Leta/Korede together on couch, supported by family**
112. **Same city, same night, different ways of processing trauma**
113. Ben has no one (isolated himself after Sarah died)
114. Tess/Leta have each other + Korede (community as healing)
115. **Both recovering from mob attack (Chapter 5)**
116. **Both processing trauma differently**
117. One through connection (Tess/Leta/Korede scene)
118. One through avoidance (Ben scene)
119. **Theme: "You don't have to be fixed to be worthy"**
120. **But you DO need people. Ben doesn't have them yet.**

---

## CHAPTER 6 SUMMARY

### Rest and Recovery Theme

**Two ways of processing trauma:**

**Scene 1 (Tess/Leta/Korede) - Connection as Healing:**
- Domestic intimacy (coming home, eating together)
- Family support (Korede + sisters, chosen family)
- Partnership (Tess protective, Leta independent, balanced)
- Community organizing (they're not alone in this)
- Early warning of harassment (support network already building response)

**Scene 2 (Ben) - Isolation as Avoidance:**
- Work obsession (building Kain case to avoid feeling)
- Grief suppressed (eight months, finally breaking through)
- Conservative ideology cracking (system failed, wife died)
- No support network (isolated himself)
- Coping mechanism failing (work doesn't heal grief)

### Character Development

**Tess:**
- Day shift dancer (professional boundaries, intel gathering)
- Protective of Leta/Korede (not overbearing yet, will become so)
- Noir-comedy energy (wit masking worry)
- Investigator instincts (pattern recognition, building cases)

**Leta:**
- Trans activist, sex worker rights organizer
- Independent, confident, knows her limits (for now)
- Dismisses early harassment (used to trolling, doesn't see coordination)
- Protective of Korede (teaching him organizing, worried about safety)

**Korede (Introduced):**
- 17, male, Leta's younger brother
- Learning activism from Leta (protests, rallies, organizing)
- Observant (noticed harassment pattern)
- Teen perspective (idealistic, hasn't seen how bad it gets yet)
- Book 4 seed: After Leta's death, partners with Tess for investigation

**Ben:**
- Wife Sarah died eight months ago (peaceful protest turned violent)
- Conservative but changing (Sarah was activist, challenged his views)
- Work obsession as grief avoidance (building Kain case compulsively)
- Coping mechanism failing (can't avoid feeling anymore)
- Isolated (pushed people away, has no support network)
- **Book 4 setup:** When system betrays him (evidence doesn't matter), breaks completely

### Thematic Function

**"You Don't Have to Be Fixed to Be Worthy":**
- Tess/Leta/Korede functioning while navigating harassment (worthy while vulnerable)
- Ben functioning while broken by grief (worthy while not healing "correctly")
- Both processing trauma differently (no "right" way to recover)

**"CBT Approach Failing":**
- Ben: Work harder → Fix grief (doesn't work, can't control loss through effort)
- Tess: Protect Leta → Control safety (won't work when harassment escalates)
- Both trying to manage outcomes (can't be controlled)

**"Both/And Thinking Needed":**
- Ben: Grieving AND functional (both true)
- Processing AND avoiding (both true)
- Broken AND worthy (both true)

### Integration with Book 2

**Month 1 Context:**
- Two days after mob attack (Chapter 5)
- Team processing trauma in downtime
- Showing civilian lives (not just superhero operations)
- Rest and recovery (before escalation continues)

**Foreshadowing:**
- Leta harassment (early stage, will escalate Months 5-7)
- Ben's grief (suppressed, will erupt when evidence fails Month 8-9)
- Korede radicalization (watching sister targeted, leads to Book 4 partnership with Tess)
- Support networks matter (Ben doesn't have one, will need one)

### Contrast Established

| Aspect | Tess/Leta/Korede | Ben |
|--------|------------------|-----|
| **Coping** | Connection | Isolation |
| **Support** | Family/community | Alone (self-imposed) |
| **Method** | Talk, share, process together | Work until exhausted, avoid feeling |
| **Effectiveness** | Healing (slow but real) | Failing (eight months, breaking down) |
| **Future** | Tested (harassment) but supported | Breaking point coming (Book 4) |

## Placement in Book 2

**Suggested Chapter:** Month 1, Scene (between Chapter 5 and Month 2)

**Function:**
- Character development (Tess/Leta relationship established)
- Foreshadowing (harassment campaign early signs)
- Contrast (domestic peace vs external threat building)
- Grounding (civilian life amidst superhero operations)

**Connects To:**
- Chapter 5: Tess mentions mob attack, bruising from patrol
- Month 5-7: Harassment escalates from these early signs
- Leah's arc: When Leah stays silent, readers remember this scene
- Tess's overprotection arc: Seeds planted here, grows later

---

## Status

**Scene complete:**
- 170 beats
- Domestic intimacy + organizing partnership established
- Foreshadowing subtle but present
- Character voices distinct (Tess noir-comedy, Leta confident activist)
- Relationship dynamic clear (protective + independent, balanced)
- External threat introduced (watcher, harassment beginning)

**Ready for:**
- Prose conversion (when needed)
- Integration with Month 1 timeline
- Callback when harassment escalates (Month 5-7)
- Contrast with later overprotective Tess (relationship strain)
