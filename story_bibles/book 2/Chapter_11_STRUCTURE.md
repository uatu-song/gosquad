# CHAPTER 11: [Title TBD] (Month 2-3)

**Timing:** Month 2-3, evening patrol
**Setting:** Caledonia streets, protest situation
**Present:** Go Squad (full team or partial TBD based on rolls)
**Theme:** Eidolon's influence beginning, fear/anger amplification, tactical decisions under pressure
**Tone:** Action-focused, visceral, tactical - team operations under stress

---

## SETUP: The Call

**Context:**
- Month 2-3, Go Squad established patrol patterns
- Ahdia [present/absent TBD based on her global operations schedule]
- Protest/demonstration happening in Caledonia (mining exploitation, environmental justice issue)
- Team monitoring, ready to intervene if police escalate
- Eidolon's influence active (amplifying emotions, making fear bigger)

**Team Status:**
- Ruth (Nightingale): Leadership, medical support
- Tess (Gloom Girl): Investigator instincts, protective of Leta, functional and focused
- Ben (Night Knight): Focused on investigation but showing up for team
- Victor (Crimson Sable): Connected to organizers, community intel
- Leah (Battlea): Learning political organizing, anger management ongoing
- Ahdia: [TBD - present with powers, or notably absent?]

---

## BEAT 1-15: Initial Situation

1. Evening patrol, Go Squad monitoring protest from rooftops
2. Peaceful demonstration currently: Signs, chants, organized march
3. Victor's community organizing contacts organized this (environmental justice)
4. Mining exploitation issue: TRIOMF operations (connects to Ben's investigation)
5. About 200 protesters, diverse crowd, families present
6. Police presence: Standard deployment, not riot gear yet
7. Team split across several rooftop positions (tactical oversight)
8. Ruth coordinating via comms, calls coming through clearly
9. Ben noting agent provocateur patterns from his investigation (watching for signs)
10. Victor on ground level, monitoring crowd, checking in with organizers
11. Tess and Leah on rooftops (partnered, watching crowd flow)
12. Protest proceeding peacefully so far, permits in order
13. But something feels off: tension higher than situation warrants
14. Ben noticing police seem more aggressive in posture than usual
15. Ruth: "Everyone see anything? This should be routine."

## FIRST DECISION POINT

**Situation:** Team monitoring peaceful protest. Something feels off - tension higher than warranted.

**Options:**
1. **Stay in position** - Continue monitoring, don't intervene unless things escalate
2. **Move closer** - Position team members closer to potential flashpoints
3. **Victor investigates** - Send Victor to talk to organizers, see if they sense the tension
4. **Tactical repositioning** - Move team to intercept likely police advance if things go bad

**Question for the dice:** What does the team's tactical instinct suggest? (Roll to see if they sense the danger accurately)

**Roll needed:** Perception/Awareness check
- **Success (higher roll):** Team senses Eidolon's influence amplifying tensions, positions accordingly
- **Failure (lower roll):** Team thinks this is normal protest energy, doesn't adjust positioning

---

**DICE ROLL #1: Tactical Awareness - RESULT: 17 (Success)**

**Team accurately senses the danger. Something is amplifying tensions beyond what this situation warrants.**

---

## BEAT 16-30: Recognition and Repositioning

16. Ben's instinct kicks in: "This doesn't feel right. Crowd's too amped for the situation."
17. Ruth noticing same: Police body language aggressive, protesters unusually tense
18. Not normal pre-escalation energy, something else at work
19. Victor checks in via comms: "Organizers say people are angrier than expected"
20. Planned speeches about mining, but crowd already shouting, agitated
21. Leah: "Even I think this feels intense, and I'm the angry one"
22. Ben: Military experience recognizing artificially amplified tension
23. Ruth makes call: "Something's pushing this. Repositioning for rapid intervention."
24. Tactical shift: Team moves closer to likely flashpoints
25. Tess and Leah descending to street level (still rooftop access nearby)
26. Ben positioning near police line (intercept if they charge)
27. Victor staying with organizers (trying to calm, de-escalate)
28. Ruth maintaining overwatch, coordinating positions
29. Ahdia [if present: sensing something wrong with her powers, time feeling sticky]
30. Team now in position to intercept violence from either direction

## BEAT 31-45: Tension Escalates

31. Crowd energy spiking, chants becoming aggressive
32. Police shifting to riot gear (responding to crowd energy)
33. Victor trying to get organizers to call for calm
34. But something pushing against de-escalation efforts
35. Individual in crowd throws bottle (not organizer, provocateur?)
36. Police line tenses, hands on batons
37. Ben tracking the thrower: Moving through crowd tactically, trained
38. Same pattern from his Tank Kain investigation (agent provocateur)
39. Ruth: "We've got an agitator. Night Knight, can you ID?"
40. Ben trying to track through crowd, losing visual
41. Another bottle thrown from different section (coordinated?)
42. Crowd starting to surge, genuine fear mixing with anger
43. Police calling for dispersal (loudspeaker warnings)
44. But crowd can't disperse peacefully, too tight, fear spreading
45. Situation about to break

## SECOND DECISION POINT

**Situation:** Agent provocateurs throwing bottles, crowd energy spiking artificially, police about to charge. Crowd can't disperse safely - too tight, fear spreading.

**Team Options:**
1. **Stop the agitators** - Ben and team go after provocateurs, remove them from crowd
2. **Block police charge** - Position between police and crowd, prevent escalation
3. **Create exit routes** - Use smoke grenades, tactical positioning to open dispersal paths
4. **Split focus** - Some stop agitators, others create exits (divide team)

**Question for the dice:** Can the team execute their chosen tactic cleanly, or does something go wrong?

**Roll needed:** Tactical Execution check
- **Success:** Team executes plan effectively, minimizes violence
- **Failure:** Plan works partially but complications arise (Eidolon interference, unexpected variables)

---

**DICE ROLL #2: Tactical Execution (Split Focus) - RESULT: 17 (Success)**

**Ruth calls split focus. Team executes perfectly - provocateurs neutralized, exit routes opened.**

---

## BEAT 46-65: Perfect Execution

46. Ruth's call immediate: "Split focus. Night Knight, Battlea - take the agitators. Everyone else, exit routes."
47. Ben and Leah moving instantly, no hesitation
48. Victor and Tess deploying smoke grenades at strategic points
49. Ruth coordinating from overwatch: "Smoke in 3... 2... 1..."
50. Multiple smoke clouds blooming simultaneously (calculated positions)

## BEAT 66-80: Aftermath and Discovery

66. Smoke clearing, situation de-escalating rapidly
67. Police line still tense but not charging (crowd dispersing)
68. Ben examining secured provocateurs: Professional gear, earpieces, coordinated
69. Same pattern as Tank Kain: Hired agitators, not protesters
70. Victor helping organizers account for everyone (families safe)
71. Tess and Leah breathing hard but satisfied (clean operation)
72. Ruth: "Everyone check in. Injuries?"
73. Team reporting clear, no casualties, mission success
74. But Ben noticing something on provocateur's equipment
75. Earpiece still active, voices coming through
76. Listening: Coordinated attack, multiple sites planned tonight
77. Not just this protest - citywide operation
78. Ruth: "Night Knight, what are you hearing?"
79. Ben: "This wasn't isolated. They're hitting multiple protests simultaneously."
80. Team realization: This is bigger than one demonstration

## THIRD DECISION POINT

**Situation:** Team successfully stopped this protest from turning violent. But provocateur comms reveal coordinated attacks at multiple protests across Caledonia happening RIGHT NOW.

**New Information:**
- At least 3-4 other protests targeted tonight
- Same tactics (agent provocateurs, artificial escalation)
- TRIOMF operation (Ben recognizes code phrases from investigation)
- Team can't be everywhere at once

**Options:**
1. **Stay here** - Secure this site, call it a win, don't overextend
2. **Split up** - Send team members to other protests (divide resources)
3. **Call for backup** - Contact CADENS, get official support (reveals team to authorities)
4. **Alert organizers** - Warn other protest organizers about provocateurs (indirect intervention)

**Question for the dice:** If team intervenes at other sites, how effective are they while divided?

**Roll needed:** Coordination Under Pressure
- **Success:** Team coordinates effectively across multiple sites
- **Failure:** Team spreads too thin, something goes wrong at one site

---

**DICE ROLL #3: Coordination Under Pressure (Split Team) - RESULT: 7 (Failure)**

**Team splits to cover multiple sites but spreads too thin. Complications arise.**

---

## BEAT 81-100: Division and Deployment

94. Ruth tracking all three: "University is hottest. Battlea, Gloom Girl - priority target."
95. Teams engaging simultaneously across city
96. Ruth trying to coordinate but information flooding in
97. Too many variables, can't track everything
98. Ben's site escalating faster than expected (Eidolon influence stronger here?)
99. Victor calling for backup at community center (outnumbered)
100. Ruth realizing: They're spread too thin

## BEAT 101-120: University Plaza - Partial Success

118. Leah: "We didn't stop it completely. Got messy."
119. Ruth trying to process while coordinating other two sites
120. University plaza: Partial success, complications, injuries

## BEAT 121-140: Community Center - Victor Overwhelmed

134. Ruth hearing on comms: "Crimson Sable in police custody"
135. Ruth: "Victor, status?" Victor: "Detained. They think I'm the problem."

137. Violence escalating, no one stopping it
138. Ruth torn: Extract Victor or leave him and coordinate other sites?
139. Making hard call: "Victor, stay calm. We'll get you after. Focus on other sites."
140. Victor in police custody while his protest turns violent

## BEAT 141-160: Riverside Park - Ben's Worst Case

141. Ben at riverside park, smallest crowd but most violent

## FOURTH DECISION POINT

**Situation:** All three sites engaged simultaneously. Results mixed:
- **University Plaza:** Partial success, injuries, one provocateur caught
- **Community Center:** Victor detained by police, violence escalating
- **Riverside Park:** Stabbing victim, knife provocateur escaped, site lost

**Ruth's Overwatch:**
- Can't coordinate three failing operations alone
- Victor in custody, Ben extracting wounded civilian
- Leah and Tess dealing with injured protesters at university
- Need to make hard calls

**Options:**
1. **Extract everyone** - Pull team back, regroup, accept losses (tactical retreat)
2. **Prioritize Victor** - Extract him from police custody first (teammate over mission)
3. **Commit to Riverside** - Send reinforcements to Ben, try to salvage worst site
4. **Focus on University** - Secure the partial success, make it count

**Question for the dice:** Can Ruth hold the team together through cascading failures?

**Roll needed:** Leadership Under Collapse
- **Success:** Ruth keeps team focused, minimizes further damage
- **Failure:** Team cohesion breaks, someone makes emotional decision that worsens situation

---

**DICE ROLL #4: Leadership Under Collapse (Commit to Riverside) - RESULT: 17 (Success)**

**Ruth makes the bold call to salvage Riverside. Team rallies despite failures.**

---

## BEAT 161-180: Ruth's Gamble

161. Ruth processing all inputs: Victor detained, Ben with wounded, university injuries
162. Has to choose where to commit limited resources

## FIFTH DECISION POINT

**Situation:** Night over. Team extracted safely but results mixed:
- **First site (original protest):** Clean success
- **University Plaza:** Partial success, civilian injuries
- **Community Center:** Violence occurred, Victor detained then released
- **Riverside Park:** Salvaged, stabbing victim saved, knife caught

**Team Morale:**
- Exhausted, emotionally drained from cascading crises
- Ruth's leadership held them together but decisions were hard
- They saved some people but couldn't save everyone
- First major experience with Eidolon's coordinated influence

**Debrief Questions:**
1. Did Ruth make the right calls? (Leave university injuries, commit to Riverside, delay Victor extraction)
2. Should they have split up at all, or stayed at first site?
3. How do they prepare for coordinated attacks like this in the future?
4. What did they learn about the enemy's capabilities?

**Question for the dice:** How does the team process this mixed success/failure emotionally?

**Roll needed:** Team Cohesion After Trauma
- **Success:** Team processes honestly, grows from experience, bonds strengthen
- **Failure:** Fractures show, disagreements about Ruth's calls, tension emerging

---

**DICE ROLL #5: Team Cohesion After Trauma - RESULT: 18 (Excellent Success)**

**Team processes honestly. Bonds strengthen through shared trauma and Ruth's leadership.**

229. Silence. Weight of casualties settling on team.
230. Victor: "But Riverside victim would've died if we hadn't committed there."
231. Ben: "Knife provocateur would still be loose. Could've killed someone."
232. Leah: "So Ruth's call saved lives, even though it cost at university?"
233. Ruth: "I don't know. Maybe. Both/and - saved some, couldn't save all."
234. Tess: "I hated leaving those people. But... Ruth was right about the knife."
235. Victor: "Being detained sucked. But I trusted Ruth to handle it."
236. Ruth acknowledging: "I left you there longer than I wanted. Prioritized the knife."
237. Victor: "You made the triage call. That's leadership."
238. Ben: "Military taught me: Perfect mission planning fails on contact. We adapted."
239. Leah: "We saved the first site completely. That was perfect."
240. Ben: "Then we spread thin. That's on me - I heard multiple sites, pushed to cover them."

242. Team silence, processing Ruth taking accountability
243. Victor: "We all chose to go. No one forced us."

247. Ben: "Enemy can coordinate multiple simultaneous operations. More organized than expected."
248. Leah: "Same gear, same tactics, same playbook across all sites. Training."
249. Victor: "TRIOMF. Has to be. Professional provocateurs, hired muscle."
250. Tess: "Why though? What's the goal? Make protests violent?"
251. Ben: "Creates footage. Justifies crackdowns. Kain's law-and-order narrative."
252. Leah: "We stopped it at one site perfectly. Proved it's possible."
253. Victor: "But can't be everywhere. Need different strategy for coordinated attacks."
254. Ruth: "Alert networks? Warn organizers before protests?"
255. Victor: "I can do that. Community connections, protest networks."
256. Ben: "I'm tracking Titan's operations. More intel = better positioning."
257. Leah: "What about the feeling? Everything felt... bigger than it should've been."
258. Tess: "Yes! Like anger was amplified. Fear too strong for situation."
259. Ruth: "I felt it coordinating. Emotions not matching threat level."
260. Ben: "Eidolon? Same thing from police ambush? Fear manipulation?"
261. Victor: "If something's pushing emotions artificially, makes our job harder."
262. Ruth: "Something to investigate. But tonight - we adapted, we survived."
263. Leah: "We saved people. Not everyone, but we tried everything we could."
264. Tess: "And Ruth made the hard calls so we didn't have to."
265. Team looking at Ruth with respect, not resentment

## BEAT 266-280: Bonds Strengthening

266. Ruth: "I need to say something. Those calls tonight - leaving university, delaying Victor..."
267. Ruth's voice cracking slightly: "I hated making them. Still not sure they were right."
268. Leah: "But you made them anyway. When we were all paralyzed, you chose."
269. Victor: "Leadership isn't always making right calls. Sometimes it's just making calls."
270. Ben: "Military taught me: Indecision kills. You kept us moving."
271. Tess: "I trust you, Ruth. Even when your calls hurt, I trust them."
272. Ruth processing team's support, not expecting this
273. Victor: "We're not superheroes. We're people trying our best with impossible choices."
274. Leah: "Tonight proved we can't save everyone. That sucks. But we saved who we could."
275. Ben: "Seven injuries across four sites is better than dozens dead if we'd done nothing."
276. Tess: "And we got evidence. Provocateurs caught, gear documented."
277. Victor: "My community will know agents provocateurs are real now. Police saw the equipment."
278. Ruth: "So we learned, we adapted, we saved lives, we got evidence."
279. Team nodding, exhausted but united
280. Ruth: "Then we did our job. Not perfectly, but we did it."

283. Victor: "I'll prep protest networks. Early warning systems."
284. Tess: "We'll train for split operations. Better coordination protocols."
285. Ruth: "And I'll... keep making the hard calls. Someone has to."
286. Team exhausted but determined, bonds forged through shared trauma
287. Victor: "Go home. Rest. Process. We earned it."
288. Team beginning to disperse, masks off, just people now
289. Ruth stopping them: "Wait. Everyone... thank you. For trusting me tonight."
290. Leah: "Thank you for leading. Even when it sucked."
291. Team exchanging nods, small gestures of solidarity
292. Ben leaving first (needs to process alone, military habit)
293. Tess and Leah together (partners, supporting each other)
294. Victor and Ruth last (she needs to debrief more, he knows)
295. Night ending: Team fractured by failure but bonded through honesty

- Right to try AND couldn't save everyone
- All true, none cancels the others

**"CBT Approach Failing Preview":**
- Perfect execution (first site) didn't scale to multiple sites
- Can't control outcome through better planning when enemy coordinates
- Trying to save everyone = saving no one (triage necessary)
- System bigger than individual heroics

**"Eidolon's Influence":**
- First major coordinated attack team recognizes
- Emotions artificially amplified (fear, anger beyond situation)
- Multiple sites = Eidolon's scale becoming apparent
- Team starting to understand enemy they're facing

### Connection to Larger Book 2 Arc

**Month 2-3 Context:**
- Eidolon testing Go Squad capabilities
- TRIOMF operations (connects to Ben's investigation)
- Ruth learning triage leadership (can't save everyone)
- Team cohesion strengthening through shared trauma

**Evidence for Ben's Month 8 Leak:**
- Tonight's provocateurs add to comprehensive case
- Multiple sites prove coordination
- Gear evidence shows professional operation
- Pattern supporting his riot investigation

**Leadership Lessons for Ruth:**
- Accept you can't save everyone (Phase 2 complete)
- Make hard calls knowing they're wrong to someone (practiced tonight)
- Trust team's autonomy (Victor stayed calm, team rallied)
- Triage thinking under pressure (Riverside prioritized correctly)

### Dice Roll Summary
1. **Tactical Awareness (17):** Team senses danger accurately, positions well
2. **Tactical Execution - Split Focus (17):** Perfect execution at first site
3. **Coordination Under Pressure - Split Team (7):** Spreads too thin, complications arise
4. **Leadership Under Collapse - Commit to Riverside (17):** Bold gamble pays off
5. **Team Cohesion After Trauma (18):** Honest processing, bonds strengthen

**Overall:** Night of high stakes, mixed results, strong team growth through adversity
