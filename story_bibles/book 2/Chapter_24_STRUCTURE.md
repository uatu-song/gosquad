# CHAPTER 24: Election Night

**Month:** 12 (November, Election Day/Night)
**POV:** Ensemble (Ahdia focus during mission), election coverage interwoven
**Tone:** Desperate mission → Sacrifice → Bitter victory → Devastating loss
**Purpose:** Stop global coup (succeed), lose election (fail)—CBT approach failure complete

---

## Summary

**Setting:** Safe house → Fusion reactor facility (Southwest), election coverage throughout

Saturday is preparation—team resting, planning, Ahdia knowing what comes next. Sunday arrives: Election Day. While America votes, the team translocates to the fusion reactor facility where TRIOMF is coordinating a global coup (28 positions, synchronized takeover at midnight). Ahdia burns critically just getting them there. At the reactor, they discover the coordination signal launching at midnight—same moment election results project. Must disrupt quantum-entangled communication network physically. Bourn has technical knowledge, Ahdia has time manipulation. The choice: Safe disruption (might miss window, Ahdia survives) OR massive freeze (guaranteed stop, Ahdia burns past threshold). She chooses massive freeze. Stops the coup, burns herself critically. Emergency CADENS treatment stabilizes her barely—baseline drops further, she's on final borrowed time. They succeed. Coup prevented, Bourn alive, 28 positions stay empty, global catastrophe averted. Then election results project: **KAIN WINS.** Perfect evidence public, coup stopped, truth everywhere, and he still won. Team watches from reactor facility. Did everything right. Lost anyway. Chapter ends with team returning to Caledonia, devastated victory in hands, democracy failed anyway, Ahdia barely alive, everyone processing: "We saved the world and lost our country."

**Core Conflict:** Global coup vs Individual sacrifice, Victory vs Defeat simultaneously
**Thematic Beat:** "You don't have to be fixed to be worthy"—effort mattered even though election lost
**Character Arc:** Team achieves perfect execution, loses election anyway, CBT failure complete
**Both/And:** Coup stopped (victory) AND Kain wins (defeat), worthy AND failing, saved everyone AND lost

---

## Opening Beat

**Saturday morning (Day after FAERIS intervention)**
**Safe house, team recovering**

**The Calm:**
- Window opened (Eidolon weakened, not gone)
- 36 hours to Election Night
- Everyone injured, exhausted, alive
- Processing: Hunted by thousands, saved by reality TV

**Ahdia Alone (Early Morning):**
- Can't sleep (baseline <10%, treatment barely helping)
- Watching Great British Bake Off muted
- Knowing: Tomorrow requires massive burn
- Might not survive threshold crossing
- Ruth's medical assessment: "You might not come back"
- Texting FAERIS: "Thank you for the window. I'll use it."
- FAERIS: "Probability of survival: 23%. Proceed anyway?"
- Ahdia: "Yeah. Proceed anyway."

**Team Waking:**
- Ruth checking Ahdia's baseline (still critical)
- Ben reviewing Bourn's intel (Titan coup mechanics)
- Tess and Leta together (relationship strained, survived together)
- Leah processing (hunted after speaking up, radicalized)
- Victor preparing (community networks recovering)
- Korede watching (teen learning what fighting costs)

**The Reality:**
- Tomorrow: Election Day
- Midnight: Titan global coup executes
- Must reach fusion reactor (Southwest, 800 miles away)
- Disrupt coordination signal (quantum network)
- Ahdia must translocate team (burns critically)
- Then disrupt reactor (burns more, possibly fatally)
- While America votes

---

## Act 1: Preparation (Saturday)

### Scene 1: The Plan
**Safe house, morning strategy session**

**Director Bourn's Intel (Complete):**
- TRIOMF: 28 positions ready for takeover
- Positions = Ahdia's Exile Island targets (Eidolon guided selection)
- Operatives positioned: Cartels, militaries, governments
- Coordination signal: Fusion reactor quantum network
- Launch time: Midnight Election Night (symbolic timing)
- If signal launches: Simultaneous global coup, irreversible
- Only stoppable: Physical disruption at reactor core

**Mission Parameters:**
- **Distance:** 800 miles to Southwest fusion reactor facility
- **Time:** 36 hours (Saturday morning → Sunday midnight)
- **Transport:** Ahdia translocation (only option, costs critically)
- **Team:** Go Squad + Director Bourn (needs her technical knowledge)
- **Objective:** Disrupt quantum-entangled communication network
- **Method:** Freeze reactor core while Bourn disrupts quantum field
- **Constraint:** Midnight deadline, election results same night

**Ruth's Medical Assessment:**
- Ahdia baseline: <10% (minutes from transcendence threshold)
- Translocation cost: 2-3 minutes burned (getting there)
- Reactor disruption: Unknown duration, massive freeze required
- Total cost: Likely exceeds remaining reserves
- **"You might not survive this."**
- Ahdia: "And if I don't go, global coup succeeds."
- Ruth: "There has to be another way."
- Ahdia: "There isn't. We use the window FAERIS gave us."

**Team Processing:**
- **Ben:** "Military precision. We've run impossible missions before."
- **Tess:** "Not this impossible."
- **Leah:** "We're asking her to die to stop a coup on election night?"
- **Victor:** "We're not asking. She's choosing."
- **Leta:** "Can we... help somehow? Split the load?"
- **Ahdia:** "Powers don't work like that. It's me or no one."
- **Korede:** [silent, watching, learning what heroism costs]

**The Vote:**
- Team doesn't vote (Ahdia already decided)
- Everyone knows: Mission necessary
- Everyone knows: Probably costs Ahdia
- Everyone going anyway
- "We do this together. Whatever happens."

### Scene 2: Last Conversations
**Saturday afternoon, quiet moments**

**Ruth & Ahdia (Medical Prep):**
- Treatment session (last before mission)
- Ruth: "I can't save you if you cross threshold."
- Ahdia: "I know."
- Ruth: "Then why—"
- Ahdia: "Because 28 positions, global coup, millions dead. That's why."
- Ruth: "You're not responsible for saving everyone."
- Ahdia: "No. But I'm responsible for trying."
- Ruth: [grief surfacing] "I couldn't save Firas. I can't lose you too."
- Ahdia: "You won't lose me. 23% survival probability."
- Ruth: "That's not comforting."
- Ahdia: "It's not zero. Both/and."

**Ben & Ahdia (Ideology):**
- Ben: "Your TV thing saved us. Exile Island."
- Ahdia: "Parks and Rec taught me power deflation."
- Ben: "I spent eight months building evidence. You watched reality TV. Yours worked."
- Ahdia: "Yours mattered too. Community knows Isaiah's truth."
- Ben: "Kain's still winning."
- Ahdia: "Yeah. But we tried everything. That has to count."
- Ben: "Does it?"
- Ahdia: "Ask me after tomorrow."

**Tess & Ahdia (Justice):**
- Tess: "Officers cleared. Father protected them. System works as designed."
- Ahdia: "But you documented everything. Community knows."
- Tess: "Is that enough?"
- Ahdia: "I don't know. But it's not nothing."
- Tess: "Tomorrow you might die stopping a coup most people don't know exists."
- Ahdia: "Yeah."
- Tess: "That's fucked up."
- Ahdia: "Yeah. Both/and."

**Leah & Ahdia (Growth):**
- Leah: "I spoke up. Released recording. Almost died."
- Ahdia: "You connected survivors. That mattered."
- Leah: "He's still winning. Recording failed."
- Ahdia: "You did the right thing. Outcome doesn't erase that."
- Leah: "How do you keep trying when it doesn't work?"
- Ahdia: "I don't know. I just... keep trying. What else would I do?"
- Leah: "White moderate finally gets it. Systemic resistance isn't optional."
- Ahdia: "Welcome to the work. It sucks. You keep doing it anyway."

**Team Dinner (Evening):**
- Thai food delivery (Ahdia's tradition)
- Everyone together, quiet
- Not talking about mission (talking around it)
- Victor telling organizing stories (long view)
- Leta and Tess holding hands
- Korede asking questions (teen perspective)
- Ruth watching Ahdia (medical concern visible)
- Ben documenting (habit, always evidence)
- Last meal together (everyone knows it might be)

---

## Act 2: Election Day (Sunday Morning → Afternoon)

### Scene 3: America Votes
**Sunday morning, safe house**

**Election Day Coverage (Background Throughout):**
- TV coverage: "Record turnout expected"
- Polling: Kain +10 points (lead holding)
- Pundits: "Despite controversies, Kain's victory looks inevitable"
- Tank Kain evidence: Discussed, priced in
- Isaiah vindication: Mentioned, forgotten
- Leah's recording: "Scandal couldn't stop momentum"

**Team Watching:**
- Evidence everywhere: Public, verified, undeniable
- Kain winning anyway
- Eidolon amplification: Fear > truth
- Everyone voting (Ben mail ballot weeks ago, others not registered in Caledonia)
- Knowing: Election likely lost before today began

**Translocation Prep:**
- Ruth: Final medical check (Ahdia baseline barely holding)
- Bourn: Technical briefing (quantum network mechanics)
- Team: Gear, weapons (non-lethal), comms equipment
- Ahdia: Eating pad thai, watching Great British Bake Off
- "Ready when you are."

### Scene 4: The Translocation (Noon)
**Safe house → Fusion reactor (Southwest facility)**

**The Burn:**
- Eight people simultaneous translocation
- 800 miles instant
- Ahdia: Freezing time, manipulating space
- Cost: 3 minutes lifespan (more than estimated)
- Baseline drops: <10% → ~7%
- Arrival: Everyone intact, Ahdia barely standing

**Reactor Facility (Southwest Desert):**
- Massive industrial complex
- Fusion reactor: Isaiah's project (irony noted)
- Security: Titan operatives, Palmer's team
- Countdown: 12 hours to midnight
- Election coverage on facility screens

**Ruth's Assessment (Immediate):**
- Ahdia critical: Baseline ~7%, near threshold
- Any further freeze: Crosses into transcendence zone
- "You can't freeze reactor core. You'll transcend."
- Ahdia: "Then I'll transcend. Coup stops either way."
- Ruth: "That's not a plan!"
- Ahdia: "It's the only plan."

### Scene 5: Infiltration (Afternoon)
**Reactor facility, 10 hours to midnight**

**Team Dynamics:**
- **Ben:** Military tactics, leading infiltration
- **Tess:** Parkour, vertical approach routes
- **Victor:** Non-violent disruption (worker solidarity)
- **Leta & Leah:** Digital systems, comms disruption
- **Ruth:** Medical support, team coordination
- **Korede:** Observation, learning
- **Bourn:** Technical expertise, guiding to quantum core
- **Ahdia:** Reserve power (can't waste freezes)

**Facility Workers:**
- Many unaware of coup coordination
- Isaiah's colleagues: Working on "clean energy"
- Community impact: Jobs, infrastructure, hope
- Both/and: Necessary technology, corrupt implementation
- Victor connecting with workers (solidarity, sabotage)

**Operatives Present:**
- Palmer's team securing facility
- TRIOMF coordination center
- 28 operatives networked globally
- Waiting for midnight signal
- Will execute synchronized takeover

**Election Coverage (Screens Throughout):**
- "Polls closing soon on East Coast"
- "Early exit polls show tight race"
- "Kain campaign confident"
- Team ignoring coverage (focused on coup)
- But aware: Election happening simultaneously

---

## Act 3: Midnight (The Choice)

### Scene 6: The Quantum Core (11 PM)
**Reactor heart, countdown to midnight**

**The Setup:**
- Quantum-entangled communication network
- 28 nodes worldwide connected
- Coordination signal: Launches midnight exactly
- Signal = synchronized coup (cartels, militaries, governments)
- Only stoppable: Reactor core disruption

**Bourn's Technical Assessment:**
- "Core must be frozen while I disrupt quantum field"
- "Duration: 8-10 minutes minimum for safe disruption"
- "Freeze shorter = might miss nodes, coup executes anyway"
- "Freeze longer = guaranteed disruption, no survivors"

**Ahdia's Choice:**
- Baseline: ~7% (minutes from threshold)
- Safe freeze: 3-4 minutes (might miss window, she survives)
- Guaranteed freeze: 10+ minutes (no window missed, she transcends)
- Ruth: "Please choose safe option. 23% survival becomes 0%."
- Ahdia: "And if we miss window? Millions die."
- Ruth: "You can't save everyone!"
- Ahdia: "No. But I can save these people. So I will."

**Team Protest:**
- Ben: "There has to be another way."
- Tess: "We can fight our way out, regroup, try again."
- Ahdia: "No time. Midnight is now. This is the way."
- Victor: "You're allowed to choose yourself."
- Ahdia: "I am choosing myself. This is who I am."
- Leah: "You're going to die."
- Ahdia: "Probably. 23% says maybe not. I'll take those odds."

**Ruth's Grief:**
- Medical perspective: Knows what transcendence means
- Losing Firas: Couldn't save him
- Losing Ahdia: Can't save her either
- "I hate this."
- Ahdia: "I know. I'm sorry."
- Ruth: "Don't apologize. Just... come back."
- Ahdia: "I'll try. 23%. Both/and."

### Scene 7: The Freeze (Midnight)
**Reactor core, Election Night**

**Countdown:**
- 11:59 PM
- Coordination signal launching
- 28 nodes connecting
- Global coup executing
- Team positioned
- Ahdia at core

**The Massive Freeze:**
- Ahdia: Time stop, reactor core frozen
- Bourn: Disrupting quantum field (technical precision)
- Duration: 10 minutes, 47 seconds (longer than safe)
- Ahdia burning: Every second costs
- Baseline dropping: 7% → 5% → 3% → 1%
- Threshold approaching: Can feel transcendence pulling
- Holding anyway: Must guarantee disruption

**Team Watching (Outside Freeze):**
- Ten minutes frozen time = instant for them
- Ahdia and Bourn: Working in stopped time
- Team: Waiting, fighting Titan operatives
- Election coverage: Results starting to project
- Unable to help, only wait

**The Cost:**
- Baseline hits 0.5% (past survival threshold)
- Transcendence zone: Can feel human form shedding
- Holding against pull: Will matters, barely
- Bourn: "Disruption complete! All nodes offline!"
- Ahdia: Releases freeze, collapses
- Baseline: <1%, critical emergency

### Scene 8: Emergency Treatment (12:10 AM)
**Reactor facility, just past midnight**

**Ruth's Medical Response:**
- Emergency CADENS treatment (portable equipment)
- Stabilizing Ahdia (barely)
- Baseline: 0.7% (survived, but on absolute final reserve)
- "She's alive. For now. She can't do this again."
- Every treatment less effective (approaching limit)
- "This was her last burn. Next one, she doesn't come back."

**Mission Success:**
- Quantum network: Disrupted
- 28 nodes: Offline
- Coordination signal: Failed
- Global coup: Prevented
- Titan operatives: Scattering
- Bourn: Alive, has evidence
- Team: Intact

**Then The Screen Shows:**
- "BREAKING: AP PROJECTS KAIN WINS PRESIDENCY"
- Electoral college: Kain 312, Opponent 226
- Popular vote: Kain +2.5% (despite controversies)
- Victory speech: Kain thanking supporters
- "We did it. We saved America."

**Team Processing:**
- Stopped global coup (saved millions)
- Lost election (Kain won)
- Evidence public (everyone knew everything)
- Didn't matter (fear beat truth)
- Both/and: Victory AND defeat

---

## Closing Beat

**Early Monday morning (Post-Election)**
**Reactor facility, dawn approaching**

**Ahdia Conscious (Barely):**
- Ruth beside her: "You did it. Coup stopped."
- Ahdia: "Election?"
- Ruth: "Kain won."
- Ahdia: "...both/and."
- Ruth: "Both/and."

**Team Gathering:**
- Sitting in reactor control room
- Screens showing: Kain victory coverage
- Evidence everywhere: Their year's work visible
- Coup prevented: Their night's work successful
- Election lost: Fear won anyway

**Ben's Processing:**
- "Perfect case. Public leak. Isaiah vindicated. Recording released."
- "We stopped a global coup."
- "We did everything right."
- "And we still lost."
- Victor: "We didn't lose everything. Coup prevented."
- Ben: "But we lost the country."
- Victor: "We lost one election. We keep organizing."

**Tess's Perspective:**
- "Officers cleared. Father protected them."
- "But community knows Isaiah was right."
- "Coup stopped. But democracy failed."
- "Everything's both/and."
- Leta: "We survived. That's something."
- Tess: "Yeah. That's something."

**Leah's Understanding:**
- "Spoke up. Released recording. Nearly died."
- "He won anyway."
- "Systemic resistance isn't optional. It's just... constant."
- Victor: "Now you get it."
- Leah: "I hate getting it."
- Victor: "Everyone does. We do it anyway."

**The Return:**
- Must get back to Caledonia (Ahdia can't translocate)
- Drive: 14 hours
- Processing: Election loss while traveling
- America waking up: Kain is president-elect
- Team exhausted: Did everything, saved world, lost country

**Final Image:**
- Team loading into van
- Ahdia barely mobile (Ruth supporting)
- Bourn with evidence (Titan documentation)
- Election coverage on every screen: "KAIN VICTORY"
- Desert sunrise
- Everyone: Worthy AND losing, saved everyone AND failed
- 14 hours to Caledonia
- Then: Whatever comes next

**[Prime watching from distance—mysterious figure, not revealed yet]**

## Character Beats

### Ahdia's Arc (Central This Chapter)
**Choice:** Safe freeze (survives) vs Guaranteed freeze (might transcend)
**Decision:** "This is who I am"—chooses guaranteed, knows cost
**Execution:** 10 min 47 sec freeze, burns past threshold
**Survival:** 0.7% baseline (absolute final reserve)
**Cost:** "She can't do this again. Next one, she doesn't come back."
**Victory:** Coup stopped, millions saved
**Defeat:** Election lost anyway

**Limitation Expressed:** Avoidance overcome by direct confrontation of death
**Cost Paid:** Burned to final reserve, might not survive transcendence next time
**Both/And:** Saved millions AND lost country, alive AND barely, worthy AND depleted

### Ruth's Arc
**Medical Role:** Treating Ahdia, watching her burn
**Leadership:** Team coordination, medical triage
**Personal:** Losing Firas echo, can't save everyone
**"I hate this":** Watching friend choose probable death
**Emergency Treatment:** Stabilizes Ahdia (barely)
**Processing:** We saved world, lost election, both/and

**Limitation Expressed:** Can't save everyone (learning this repeatedly)
**Cost Paid:** Watching Ahdia nearly die, election failure
**Both/And:** Successfully treated AND insufficient, leader AND powerless

### Ben's Arc
**Role:** Military tactics, infiltration leadership
**Processing:** "We did everything right and still lost"
**Conservative Faith:** Shattered completely by election results
**Evidence Perfect:** Public, verified, everyone knew
**Outcome:** Kain won anyway (fear > truth)
**New Framework:** Operating without ideology, just trying

**Limitation Expressed:** Faith in evidence/truth destroyed
**Cost Paid:** Country lost despite perfect execution
**Both/And:** Mission success AND election failure, worthy AND broken

### Team Processing
**Collective:** Perfect execution, coup prevented, election lost
**Everyone:** Did the work, evidence public, still failed
**Victory:** Millions saved (coup stopped)
**Defeat:** Democracy failed (Kain won)
**Worthy:** Effort mattered regardless of outcome
**Continuing:** Don't know how, will anyway

  - Ahdia broken (depleted), still saved millions
  - Team fractured (exhausted), still stopped coup
  - Evidence perfect (public), still mattered despite election
  - Effort worthy regardless of outcome
- **CBT Approach Failed Completely:** Perfect execution didn't control outcome
- **Both/And Everywhere:** Victory AND defeat, worthy AND failing, saved world AND lost country

## Canon Compliance Checks

### Fusion Reactor Mission
✓ Southwest facility (Isaiah's project)
✓ TRIOMF coordination center
✓ 28 positions targeted (Exile Island vacancies)
✓ Quantum-entangled communication network
✓ Midnight deadline (Election Night)
✓ Bourn has technical knowledge
✓ Ahdia time manipulation required
✓ Only stoppable physically at reactor

### Ahdia's Sacrifice
✓ Baseline <10% before mission
✓ Translocation burns 3 minutes (critical)
✓ Choice: Safe vs Guaranteed freeze
✓ Chooses guaranteed (10+ min freeze)
✓ Burns past threshold (0.7% survival)
✓ Emergency CADENS treatment stabilizes
✓ "Can't do this again—next one, she doesn't come back"

### Election Results
✓ Kain wins presidency
✓ Despite all evidence public
✓ Tank Kain, Isaiah vindication, recording, riot orchestration
✓ Eidolon amplification successful (fear > truth)
✓ Team watches results after coup stopped
✓ "Did everything right and still lost"

### Character States (Post-Election)
✓ Ahdia: Alive, critically depleted (0.7% baseline)
✓ Ben: Conservative faith shattered completely
✓ Tess: Officers cleared, father's betrayal complete
✓ Leah: White moderate radicalized, systemic understanding
✓ Victor: Long view maintained, organizing continues
✓ Leta: Harassment survivor, alive (dies Book 3/4)
✓ Ruth: Team leader, grief processing, triage thinking
✓ Korede: Teen observer, learning costs

## Writing Notes

### Pacing Structure
- **Act 1 (Saturday):** Preparation, character moments, last conversations
- **Act 2 (Sunday):** Translocation, infiltration, countdown
- **Act 3 (Midnight):** The freeze, sacrifice, results
- Balance: Mission tension + Character processing + Election coverage

### Ahdia's Choice Scene
- Most important moment: Her decision to choose guaranteed freeze
- Not suicidal (23% survival hope)
- Not heroic sacrifice rhetoric (just "this is who I am")
- Ruth's protest: Medical perspective, grief from Firas
- Team protest: Everyone offers alternatives
- Ahdia: Clear-eyed choice, knows cost, does it anyway

### The Freeze Itself
- Duration: 10 minutes 47 seconds (specific, felt)
- Inside freeze: Ahdia experiencing time, feeling threshold pull
- Outside freeze: Team fighting, waiting, watching election
- Cost visible: Baseline dropping, transcendence approaching
- Success: Bourn completes disruption, all nodes offline
- Collapse: Ahdia releases, falls, barely alive

### Election Results Reveal
- Timing: Just after mission success
- Contrast: Victory (coup stopped) + Defeat (Kain won)
- Screen shows: "AP PROJECTS KAIN WINS PRESIDENCY"
- Team: Silent processing
- All year's work: Visible on that screen, didn't matter
- Both/and: Everything and nothing simultaneously

### Avoid
- Making sacrifice feel inevitable (Ahdia chooses)
- Heroic sacrifice rhetoric (just trying, 23% hope)
- Skipping team's protest (everyone tries to stop her)
- Rushing election results (need to feel contrast)
- Despair spiral (exhaustion yes, giving up no)
- Explaining themes (show through reaction)

## Closing Beat (REVISED - Book 2 Ending)

**Tuesday evening, Ahdia's penthouse**
**Post-election +1, team returned**

**The Return:**
- Team drove back Monday (14 hours, exhausted)
- Now scattered to process (some stayed, some left)
- Ahdia: 0.5% baseline, critically depleted
- Ruth: Asleep on couch (monitoring equipment)
- TV: Muted Kain coverage (won anyway)

**Ahdia Alone:**
- Can't sleep (too much: election, coup, burned critically)
- Balcony door open (November air)
- Watching Great British Bake Off muted
- Processing: Saved millions, lost country, both/and

**The Feeling:**
- Something wrong (not medical—presence)
- Watched (not paranoia—real)
- Turn toward balcony: **Someone's there**

**Final Paragraphs:**

*A woman stands on the balcony, silhouette against city lights. Same height, same build, wearing jeans and a t-shirt like Ahdia always does. But older—mid-forties maybe—with the same curl pattern in longer, graying hair.*

*Ahdia freezes time instinctively. 0.3% now. Can't waste reserves. But the woman on the balcony doesn't freeze.*

*She turns. Her face—*

*Ahdia's face. Fifteen, twenty years older. Exhausted beyond anything Ahdia's ever seen, even in mirrors after burning 47 minutes. Scars Ahdia recognizes from protests and fights, and scars she doesn't recognize at all.*

*"You can't freeze me," the woman says, voice exactly like Ahdia's but deeper, worn. "We're the same person."*

*Ahdia releases the freeze. Speaks through numb lips: "You're from the future."*

*"No." The woman—Prime, she'll later call herself—steps closer. "I'm from the past. Three pasts, actually."*

*"There were three other timelines before this one. I lived through all of them. I'm you. The first one. The original." A tired, broken smile. "You're the fourth."*

*She glances at the muted TV showing Kain's face. "This timeline—yours—it's the compromise I chose. The lesser evil. Kain wins, but humanity survives." She looks back at Ahdia, and her expression is haunted in a way that makes 0.3% baseline look healthy. "The other three... I had to leave them there. Abandon them. Younger versions of you, alone in collapsed utopias."*

*Ahdia can't speak. Can't process. Fourth iteration. Lesser evil. Abandoned versions. The weight is—*

*"We need to talk," Prime says quietly. "About the other three timelines. About what I did. About what's coming next."*

*And then she starts to glow—soft light from inside, growing brighter. Like Firas at the end. Like crossing threshold.*

*"Wait—" Ahdia manages.*

*But Prime's already dissolving into pure light, human form shedding like she's tired of holding it. The last thing Ahdia hears:*

*"Tomorrow night. Midnight. I'll explain everything."*

*And then she's gone.*

*Ahdia stands alone on the balcony. Saved millions today. Lost the election. Burned to 0.3%. Found out she's the fourth iteration in someone else's time loop. Not the original. Never was.*

*Inside, Ruth's monitoring equipment beeps steadily. The TV plays silent coverage of President-elect Kain. The city below has no idea a global coup was prevented today.*

*Three other versions of her, abandoned in failed timelines. This world, the compromise choice. The lesser evil.*

*Both/and. Always both/and.*

*Ahdia goes inside. Closes the balcony door. Doesn't wake Ruth.*

*Tomorrow at midnight, she'll get answers.*

*Tonight, she just needs to survive until morning.*
