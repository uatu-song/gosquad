# CHAPTER 3: Investigation (CORRECTED MECHANICS)

**Generated:** 2025-10-10
**TTRPG Results:**
- Ahdia investigation: Roll 2+2=4 vs difficulty 8 → Success with complication
  - Cost: Relationship friction (good deed creates tension)
  - Limitation: Powers cost lifespan
- Ruth examination: Roll 3+3=6 vs difficulty 7 → Success with complication
  - Cost: Emotional toll (suppressed feelings surface)
  - Limitation: Grief over Firas unprocessed
- Ben's trace: Roll 4+2=6 vs difficulty 7 → Success with complication
  - Cost: Depression worsens (isolation deepens)
  - Limitation: Pushed beyond comfort zone

**Theme:** Competent but broken - they succeed at investigation but it costs them

---

## SCENE 1: CADENS Facility - Command Center

**Setting:** 3 AM, day after assassination. CADENS command center, multiple screens showing debate footage, satellite feeds, news coverage.

**Present:** Ahdia, Ruth, Ben, Leah, Tess, Victor, Korede. Harriet Bourn. Dr. Ryu monitoring.

### Beat 1: The Offer

1. Bourn addresses Go Squad: "Geneva Windrow was our ally. We need to know who killed her."
2. CADENS has resources: satellite footage, electromagnetic trace data, full surveillance
3. BUT: This is unofficial. If asked, CADENS was never involved.
4. Ahdia: "So you want us to investigate your off-the-books ally while you maintain plausible deniability?"
5. Bourn: "I want whoever did this caught. Our hands are tied. Yours aren't."
6. Ruth (team leader decision): "We're in. She died defending us."

### Beat 2: The Setup

7. Ryu pulls up data: "We have the debate hall footage from 47 angles. Satellite thermal. EM spectrum analysis."
8. Also: Windrow's body is en route to CADENS medical (official story: autopsy at county morgue)
9. Three-pronged investigation:
   - Ahdia: Crime scene analysis (debate hall, use time powers + HUD tech)
   - Ruth: Medical examination (determine exact cause of death, ballistics)
   - Ben: Trace escape route (satellite data, tactical analysis)
10. Team splits up, Victor/Leah/Tess/Korede on support

### Beat 3: Team Friction Begins (COST: Relationship friction)

11. Leah (to Ahdia): "Should you be using your powers this much? The treatment..."
12. Ahdia (dismissive): "I'm fine."
13. Leah: "You're not. Ruth said the lifespan burn is accelerating—"
14. Ahdia (sharp): "Ruth said that to YOU?"
15. Tension: Ahdia feels like they're talking about her behind her back
16. Leah trying to help, but it creates friction
17. Ahdia isolates further (limitation: avoidance as coping mechanism)

---

## SCENE 2: Debate Hall - Crime Scene Investigation

**Setting:** Debate stage, frozen in aftermath. Blood stains. Empty podium where Windrow fell. Caution tape. CADENS has cleared official investigators for one hour.

**Present:** Ahdia, Tess, Korede. FAERIS drones overhead. Dr. Ryu on comms.

### Beat 4: Freeze Time Investigation (CORRECT MECHANICS)

18. Ahdia activates time freeze
19. World stops: dust particles frozen mid-air, caution tape motionless
20. HUD activates: distance markers, thermal overlays, trajectory analysis
21. AR-Ryu flickers into view: "I'm here. Show me what you see."
22. Ahdia examines blood spatter patterns (HUD zoom 20x magnification)
23. Trajectory analysis: shot came from upper balcony, stage left
24. Walks through frozen time to balcony position

### Beat 5: The Sniper's Position

25. Balcony: indentation in carpet (tripod), faint thermal signature (hours old but detectable)
26. HUD highlights: brass casing under seat (7.62mm, custom load)
27. More disturbing: NO other evidence. No fiber, no prints, no DNA.
28. Professional. Military-grade cleanup.
29. AR-Ryu: "Check the exit vector. How did they leave?"

### Beat 6: The Impossible Exit

30. Ahdia follows probable escape route (still in frozen time)
31. Emergency exit should have alarmed → finds alarm bypassed (expert work)
32. Stairwell shows thermal ghosts (someone moved here 90 minutes ago)
33. But then: trail vanishes. Completely.
34. No thermal signature continuing down stairs
35. No exit through doors
36. It's like the sniper *disappeared*

### Beat 7: Lifespan Cost (LIMITATION: Powers cost lifespan)

37. Ahdia has held freeze for 47 minutes (external time: 0.003 seconds)
38. Chest pain intensifying (Hyper Seed burning through her)
39. AR-Ryu: "Your readings are spiking. You need to unfreeze."
40. Ahdia: "Not yet. I'm missing something."
41. AR-Ryu: "You're burning days. Plural. This isn't sustainable."
42. Ahdia: "I don't care."
43. But she does. She feels it. The cold spreading deeper.

### Beat 8: The Discovery (SUCCESS WITH COMPLICATION)

44. One more sweep: HUD set to EM spectrum analysis
45. Faint trace on stairwell wall (electromagnetic residue)
46. Pattern matches: translocation signature (same as CADENS tech)
47. The sniper didn't walk out. They teleported.
48. Which means: access to CADENS-level technology or better
49. Ahdia unfreezes time (47x force amplification makes her stumble)
50. Tess catches her: "You okay?"
51. Ahdia (lying): "Fine. Got what we needed."

### Beat 9: Reporting Findings

52. Tess: "What'd you find?"
53. Ahdia explains: professional shooter, translocation tech, impossible to trace
54. Korede (quiet observation): "So someone with CADENS-level resources killed her?"
55. Ahdia: "Or someone who stole their tech. Or someone CADENS contracts with."
56. Tess: "So we can't trust them."
57. Ahdia: "We can't trust anyone."
58. (Relationship friction deepening: paranoia setting in)

## SCENE 3: CADENS Medical Bay - Autopsy

**Setting:** Sterile medical facility. Geneva Windrow's body on examination table. Ruth in surgical gear. Victor observing (requested by Ruth for moral support).

**Present:** Ruth, Victor. Ryu monitoring remotely.

### Beat 10: Medical Examination

59. Ruth begins examination: entry wound upper chest, exit wound thoracic spine
60. Clean shot. Instant death. Professional work.
61. Victor (softly): "She died protecting them. That means something."
62. Ruth (clinical): "It means she's dead. Meaning doesn't bring people back."
63. Victor recognizes the tone: Ruth in "surgeon mode" (emotional walls up)

### Beat 11: The Anomaly

64. Ruth extracts bullet fragments from exit wound site
65. Ballistics are wrong: fragmentation pattern doesn't match entry wound
66. Like the bullet *changed* mid-flight
67. Ryu (over comms): "That's not possible with standard ammunition."
68. Ruth: "Then it wasn't standard."

### Beat 12: Emotional Toll (COST: Suppressed feelings surface)

69. Ruth washing up, Victor still there
70. Victor: "You okay?"
71. Ruth: "I'm fine. Just another autopsy."
72. Victor: "She was your age. Fighting for the same things we are."
73. Ruth: "Don't."
74. Victor: "Don't what?"
75. Ruth (cracking): "Don't make me feel this. I need to stay clinical. If I start feeling—"
76. She stops. Grief over Firas bleeding through (LIMITATION).

### Beat 13: Victor's Support

77. Victor doesn't push. Just waits.
78. Ruth (quiet): "Every time I see a body on this table, it's him. Every time."
79. Victor: "Firas?"
80. Ruth nods. Can't speak.
81. Victor: "You're allowed to grieve and work. Both/and."
82. Ruth: "I don't know how."
83. Victor: "Then we figure it out. Together."
84. (Seeds Book 2 theme: you don't have to be fixed to be worthy)

### Beat 14: Findings

85. Ruth pulls herself together, reports to team
86. Cause of death: catastrophic thoracic trauma, instant
87. Ammunition: exotic, possibly cataclysm-derived material
88. Implication: shooter has access to things beyond normal military
89. Victor (to team): "So military-grade tech, CADENS-level translocation, and cataclysm ammunition?"
90. Ben: "That's a very short list of people."

## SCENE 4: CADENS Tactical Analysis - Tracing the Ghost

**Setting:** Tactical analysis room. Wall of screens showing satellite footage, traffic cameras, FAERIS tracking data. Ben at workstation, drowning in data.

**Present:** Ben, Leah (assisting). Ryu supervising.

### Beat 15: Ben's Investigation

91. Ben cross-referencing: satellite thermal 2 hours before/after assassination
92. Traffic cameras in 5-block radius
93. FAERIS drone footage (all angles)
94. Every vehicle, every person, every thermal signature
95. Looking for: anyone leaving debate hall vicinity with translocation signature

### Beat 16: The Pattern That Isn't

96. Ben (frustrated): "Nothing. Every thermal signature accounts for a known individual."
97. Leah: "What about before the debate? Setting up?"
98. Ben: "Checked. No anomalies. It's like they appeared in position and vanished afterward."
99. Ryu: "Translocation can mask thermal approach if done correctly."
100. Ben: "Then how do we find them?"

### Beat 17: Depression Deepening (COST: Isolation worsens)

101. Ben has been at this for 6 hours straight
102. Leah: "Ben, you should rest."
103. Ben: "Can't. The trail's already cold. Every hour we lose—"
104. Leah: "You're not going to find them by exhausting yourself."
105. Ben (snapping): "And I'm not going to find them by sleeping while they get away."
106. Leah backs off. Ben immediately regrets it.
107. LIMITATION: Pushed beyond comfort zone (Ben's not an investigator, he's a soldier)
108. He's doing this work but it's not his skillset, feels inadequate

### Beat 18: The Lead That Goes Nowhere (SUCCESS WITH COMPLICATION)

109. Ben finds one anomaly: electromagnetic spike 47 minutes before debate
110. Location: 3 blocks away, rooftop access
111. Matches translocation signature
112. Could be: sniper arriving, setting up, translocating to debate hall position
113. But: No cameras on that rooftop. No evidence left behind.
114. SUCCESS: He found where they staged. COMPLICATION: It's a dead end.

### Beat 19: Reporting Back

115. Ben reports to team: "They staged nearby, translocated in, did the job, translocated out."
116. Ahdia: "So we know how. We don't know who or why."
117. Tess: "Why kill Geneva Windrow? She was progressive, grassroots—"
118. Korede: "She defended the Go Squad on national TV. Right before she died."
119. Silence. Everyone processing that.

---

## SCENE 5: Command Center - Team Debrief

**Setting:** Back in command center. Bourn listening to reports. Go Squad exhausted. It's now 9 AM (been up all night).

**Present:** Full team. Bourn. Ryu.

### Beat 20: Pooling Intelligence

120. Three findings:
    - Professional military-grade assassination
    - CADENS-level translocation technology
    - Cataclysm-derived ammunition
121. Conclusion: State-level actor OR cataclysm-aware private military contractor
122. Possible motive: Windrow defended Go Squad on TV
123. But: killing a presidential candidate is huge escalation

### Beat 21: Bourn's Assessment

124. Bourn: "This wasn't about Go Squad. You were the excuse, not the target."
125. Bourn: "Geneva Windrow was anti-establishment. She threatened the status quo."
126. Bourn: "Someone wanted her silenced. Used the Go Squad controversy as cover."
127. Ben: "Who benefits from her death?"
128. Bourn: "Her opponent. Harding Kain."

### Beat 22: The Kain Connection

129. Kain's campaign has been escalating (riots, agent provocateurs - from Book 2 timeline)
130. Kain owns the "Tank Kain" nickname now (from our earlier correction)
131. Kain has resources: campaign funded by dark money, military contractors
132. But: no proof connecting him to assassination
133. Ben: "I'm already building a case on him. Tank Kain massacre, riot orchestration—"
134. Bourn: "Add this to the file. But be careful. He's dangerous."

### Beat 23: The New Threat (MYSTERY CHARACTER SETUP)

135. Ryu pulls up anomaly: "There's one more thing."
136. Shows electromagnetic trace analysis from debate hall
137. The translocation signature isn't *exactly* CADENS
138. It's similar. But subtly different. More efficient.
139. Ryu: "Someone reverse-engineered our technology and improved it."
140. Ahdia: "So they're better than CADENS?"
141. Bourn: "Or they had a head start. Someone who knew our systems from inside."

### Beat 24: Paranoia Sets In (RELATIONSHIP FRICTION CLIMAX)

142. Team realizes: assassin has insider knowledge
143. Could be: CADENS operative gone rogue
144. Could be: Foreign intelligence with mole
145. Could be: Kain's people recruited someone
146. Leah (paranoid): "How do we know we can trust CADENS?"
147. Bourn: "You don't. But I just gave you classified intelligence and full facility access. That's trust on my end."
148. Ahdia: "Or it's a test."
149. Bourn doesn't deny it.

### Beat 25: The Mission

150. Bourn: "Geneva Windrow is dead. We can't change that."
151. Bourn: "But we can find who did it and make sure it doesn't happen again."
152. Bourn: "Go Squad operated in shadows. Now you're investigating a presidential assassination."
153. Bourn: "The stakes just got higher. Are you ready for this?"
154. Ruth (as team leader): "We don't have a choice."
155. Bourn: "There's always a choice. You can walk away."
156. Ruth looks at team. Exhausted. Fractured. Grieving.
157. Ruth: "We're not walking away. She died for us. We finish this."

### Beat 26: Chapter End - The Watcher

158. Team leaves CADENS facility
159. External shot: they walk to vehicles, morning sun rising
160. Victor has arm around Ruth (support from earlier scene)
161. Korede walks with Tess (protective energy)
162. Ben and Leah talking quietly (repairing friction)
163. Ahdia trails behind, isolated (always alone)

164. **Camera pulls back, reveals: someone watching from distance**
165. **Figure in shadows, face obscured**
166. **This is AHDIA-PRIME (readers don't know yet)**
167. **Watching Ahdia-4 with complicated expression: sadness? regret?**
168. **Prime turns away, disappears into crowd**

169. **Mystery established: Who is the watcher? Why do they care about Ahdia?**

## CHAPTER SUMMARY

**Investigation Results:**
- ✓ Sniper position identified
- ✓ Translocation technology confirmed
- ✓ Cataclysm ammunition analyzed
- ✓ Kain connection theorized
- ✗ Assassin identity unknown
- ✗ Motive unclear (personal vs political)
- ✗ Trail completely cold

**Character Costs:**
- Ahdia: Burned days of lifespan, team friction over health
- Ruth: Emotional walls cracking, grief surfacing
- Ben: Pushed beyond skillset, isolation deepening
- Team: Paranoia, trust issues, fractured but functional

**Setup for Book 2:**
- Kain investigation thread (Ben's arc)
- Mysterious assassin (recurring threat? or one-off?)
- Ahdia-Prime watching (mystery figure established)
- Team dynamics strained (both/and: fractured AND operational)

**Theme:** "You don't have to be fixed to be worthy"
- They succeeded at investigation despite costs
- Broken but competent
- Grieving but functional
- Fractured AND still a team

---

## POWER MECHANICS USED (CORRECTED)

✓ **Time Freeze** - Ahdia stops time, examines crime scene
✓ **HUD Analysis** - Zoom, thermal, EM spectrum, trajectory mapping
✓ **AR-Ryu** - Talks to her in frozen time via AR projection
✓ **Force Amplification** - 47x effect when unfreezing (makes her stumble)
✓ **Lifespan Cost** - Burns days/weeks holding long freezes
✓ **FAERIS Drones** - Overhead surveillance support
✓ **Translocation** - (Assassin uses it, not Ahdia)

✗ **NO REWIND** - Never goes backward in time (error corrected)

---

## NARRATIVE TONE

- **Noir investigation** - Dark, procedural, dead ends
- **Team friction** - Not breaking apart, but strained
- **Ahdia's voice** - TV references, self-deprecating, casual contemporary
- **Mystery layering** - Multiple threads (assassin, Kain, Prime watcher)
- **Competent but broken** - They solve it but it costs them

**Ready for prose conversion when needed.**
