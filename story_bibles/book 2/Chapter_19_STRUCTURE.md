**Status:** IN PROGRESS (Scene 1 complete: beats 1-250)

---

## Summary

Global news reports: World leaders, cartel bosses, war criminals vanishing without trace. Social media realizes only morally culpable people disappearing. Pentagon can't identify method. Ahdia returns home exhausted from Friday night translocations (breaking 72-hour agreement), crashes on bed watching Exile Island Episode 47 (AR-Ryu edited reality show of exiled targets). Ruth and Ryu independently arrive to check on her, scare each other (cute moment). As they approach bedroom, Ryu's brain receiver downloads AR-Ryu system specs - AI editor named after him replicating his editing style. Ryu freezes between laughing and terror. Ruth panics, bolts into room expecting disaster. Finds Ahdia asleep with show playing. Both discover Exile Island system, process the both/and complexity (effective AND horrifying AND funny AND questionable). Decide to confront Sunday at treatment.

## Integration Notes

### Exile Island System Established
- Remote island with basic amenities, no escape
- FAERIS drones filming 24/7 with professional cinematography
- AR-Ryu AI editor processes footage into reality TV episodes
- Weekly mandatory testimonials showing evolution from denial to (sometimes) remorse
- 28 subjects currently on island (cartel leaders, war criminals, dictators, traffickers)
- 47 episodes completed
- Ahdia reviews to verify correct targeting

### Global Impact Visible
- World leaders, criminals, war criminals vanishing without trace
- Social media realizes pattern: Only morally culpable disappearing
- Global trafficking down 34% in 6 weeks
- Pentagon/CIA unable to identify method
- Public terror giving way to cautious relief
- No one connects to Caledonia or Ahdia

### Character Knowledge Levels
- **Ahdia:** Knows about island, doesn't know Ruth/Ryu discovered it
- **Ruth/Ryu:** Know about island, not telling team yet
- **FAERIS:** Built system, monitoring for unknown purposes
- **Team:** Doesn't know about island system yet
- **Public:** Knows about vanishings, not method or perpetrator

### Ahdia's Pattern
- Broke 72-hour agreement Friday night (3 translocations)
- Justification: Targets were going to kill people tomorrow
- Can't help herself (pattern from Book 1)
- Reviews episodes for accountability verification
- Uses reality TV format (generational framework)

### Both/And Complexity
- System is effective (global impact measurable)
- AND horrifying (vigilante justice, no due process)
- AND darkly funny (reality TV treatment of tyrants)
- AND ethically questionable (who gave Ahdia this authority?)
- All simultaneously true
