# Theme-Based TTRPG System for Go Squad Universe

## Core Philosophy

Traditional TTRPGs reward optimization and progression toward competency. This system does the opposite: **characters are already competent, but their trauma/limitations create unpredictable interference**. Success isn't about overcoming brokenness—it's about functioning *within* it.

**Thematic foundation:** "You don't have to be fixed to be worthy" + "Acting despite fear/brokenness, not conquering it"

## Three-Axis Resolution System

Every significant action resolves across THREE dimensions simultaneously:

### 1. Task Outcome
**"Did you accomplish the thing?"**
- Uses character's core competency (investigation, combat, time manipulation, medical, etc.)
- Characters are GOOD at their skills
- This axis usually succeeds—that's not where the drama is

### 2. Cost Paid
**"What did it take from you?"**
- Physical depletion (Ahdia bleeding, exhaustion)
- Resource expenditure (burning bridges, using up favors)
- Temporal consequences (time you don't have back)
- Emotional toll (trauma activation, relationship strain)

### 3. Limitation Expressed
**"How did your brokenness show up?"**
- Depression (Ahdia's dissociation, freezing)
- Ideological crisis (Ben's faith in systems shattering)
- Avoidance (Leah's deflection from discomfort)
- Control issues (Ruth trying to fix unfixable situations)
- Fear amplification (Eidolon effects)

**Critical insight:** All three axes matter. All three advance story. A "successful" mission can still fracture the team.

## Character Creation Framework

### Core Competency
What are you GOOD at? (This rarely fails)
- Examples: Investigation, time manipulation, speed combat, medical triage, community organizing

### Limitation/Trauma
What breaks you predictably?
- Examples: Depression, institutional betrayal, white moderate discomfort, control anxiety, justified vs distorted fear

### Cost Mechanism
What does using your competency take from you?
- Examples: Life force, ideological foundation, moral compromise, team cohesion, sense of safety

### Growth Model
NOT "get better at skills"—instead:
- Function longer despite limitation
- Recognize cost earlier
- Make harder choices about when to pay it
- Two steps forward, one step back (progress isn't linear)

## Sample Character Archetypes

### Time Manipulator (Ahdia-type)
- **Competency:** Time manipulation, problem-solving with cosmic abilities
- **Limitation:** Depression, physical fragility, dissociation
- **Cost:** Life force depletion (nosebleeds, exhaustion, eventual collapse)
- **Growth:** Learning to ask for help instead of solo-carrying everything

### Investigator (Ben-type)
- **Competency:** Evidence gathering, pattern recognition, tactical analysis
- **Limitation:** Idealistic faith in systems/institutions
- **Cost:** Discovering systems protect power, not justice
- **Growth:** Operating outside broken systems while maintaining principles

### Fast Combatant (Leah-type)
- **Competency:** Speed, combat, roller derby momentum skills
- **Limitation:** Avoids political/social discomfort, centers own feelings
- **Cost:** Moral compromise through inaction/silence
- **Growth:** Staying in discomfort longer, speaking up faster (imperfectly)

### Medic/Leader (Ruth-type)
- **Competency:** Medical skills, tactical leadership, triage thinking
- **Limitation:** Need to control/fix everything, can't delegate
- **Cost:** Team autonomy, burnout, impossible responsibility
- **Growth:** Accepting she can't save everyone, making triage calls

## Gameplay Flow Example

**Scene Setup:** Infiltrating Kain's warehouse for evidence. Guards approaching.

**Traditional TTRPG:** Roll stealth → find evidence → escape or get caught

**This System:**

1. **Player declares action using competency**
   - "I freeze time" (succeeds - they're good at this)
   - "I find the evidence" (succeeds - they're good at this)
   - "I get us to the exit" (succeeds - they're good at this)

2. **GM calls for Cost roll**
   - Time manipulator: Nosebleed intensifies, vision spots, physical depletion
   - Investigator: Finds evidence BUT also finds proof handlers knew/allowed it
   - Fast combatant: Can escape BUT route passes harassment she could stop

3. **Players roll Limitation**
   - High roll = limitation shows up strongly (freeze, crisis, avoidance)
   - Low roll = function despite limitation (this time)
   - Never "overcome" permanently - it's always there

4. **Resolution: Success AND Fracture**
   - Mission accomplished (evidence acquired, team escaped)
   - But: Time manipulator is wrecked physically
   - Investigator's faith in institutions shattered
   - Fast combatant morally compromised by what she walked past
   - Leader can't fix any of it, just keep mission moving

## The Debrief Mechanic

**After every mission:** Team processes what happened

- What did we accomplish? (Task outcome)
- What did it cost us? (Individual and collective)
- How did we break? (Limitations that showed up)
- What do we do with that? (Not fix it - sit with it, support each other)

**This is where relationships deepen** - not through success, but through witnessing each other's brokenness and staying anyway.

## Victory Conditions (Non-Traditional)

Success is NOT "defeat the villain" or "complete the mission perfectly"

Success IS:
- Functioning despite limitation
- Acting despite cost
- Supporting each other's brokenness
- Choosing values over comfort
- Both/and thinking (mission succeeded AND team fractured - both true)

**Example from Book 2:** 
- They do everything right politically
- Spread resistance practice, build evidence, organize communities
- Kain still wins election
- But: They practiced acting despite fear, built networks, learned uncomfortable truths
- Political defeat AND personal/community growth - both real, both matter

## Eidolon Mechanic (Fear Amplification)

**Justified Fear vs Distorted Fear:**
- Justified: Realistic assessment of danger ("This is risky")
- Distorted: Eidolon amplification ("I'm worthless, everyone will die because of me")

**Resistance Practice:**
- Recognize distortion
- Act despite it (not overcome it)
- Channel fear into appropriate response
- Success = acting scared, not acting fearless

**Gameplay:** 
- Eidolon encounters increase Limitation roll difficulty
- But characters practicing resistance can still function
- Not immunity - just ability to act through amplified fear

## Campaign Structure Options

### Street Level (Books 1-3 era)
- Vigilante operations in Caledonia
- Corrupt police, crime, slowly uncover cosmic elements
- Powers start seeming mundane, gradually reveal cosmic origin
- Political organizing alongside patrol work

### Cosmic Resistance (Books 4-7 era)
- Each player picks genre/archetype
- Sessions rotate focus (noir mystery → space opera → spy thriller → medical drama)
- Shared timeline, consequences bleed between stories
- Hypershape artifacts with different 4D powers
- Team separated, occasional 2-3 person crossovers
- Full reunion only for endgame

### CADENS Operatives
- Play the "other side" - federal monitoring
- Moral complexity: follow orders vs do right thing
- Access to surveillance tech (FAERIS drones)
- Investigation and intelligence gathering
- Institutional betrayal from inside

### Political Organizing
- Community-level play
- Mutual aid networks, resistance practice spread
- Facing Eidolon manipulation in voter populations
- "Putting in the work" even when outcomes uncertain
- Learning: Evidence doesn't beat fear, organizing takes time

## Key Design Principles

1. **Competency is assumed** - characters are good at their thing
2. **Drama comes from cost and limitation** - not task failure
3. **Both/and, not either/or** - success AND fracture both happen
4. **Growth is messy** - two steps forward, one step back
5. **Brokenness isn't overcome** - learn to function within it
6. **Victory isn't defeating villains** - it's choosing values despite cost
7. **Support > Fix** - characters witness each other's struggles, can't solve them
8. **Theme drives mechanics** - every rule reinforces "worthy while broken"

## Sample Play Outcome

**What traditional TTRPG feels like:**
"We rolled well, defeated enemies, leveled up, got stronger"

**What this system feels like:**
"We accomplished the mission, but it cost us in ways we're still processing. I succeeded at my task while my trauma made it messy. We're more fractured now but also more honest. We're still broken AND we're still moving forward. Both things are true."

## The Fundamental Question

Most RPGs ask: "Can you overcome the challenge?"

This system asks: "What are you willing to pay to act according to your values, and can you function despite what it costs you?"

## Integration Notes for Claude

This schema represents:
- A TTRPG system where theme drives mechanics
- Success isn't binary (task/cost/limitation all matter)
- Characters already competent, trauma creates interference
- Growth = functioning despite brokenness, not overcoming it
- Maps to Go Squad universe themes perfectly

**Not actual code or game rules** - conceptual framework for how mechanics could express narrative themes.

**Could generate prose** - gameplay moments translate to narrative scenes where mechanical tension becomes emotional/thematic tension.

**Collaborative storytelling scaffolding** - dice determine "what does success cost" and "how does brokenness complicate this," not simple pass/fail.
