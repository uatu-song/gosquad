## Scene 1: Medical Assessment Through Door

**Beat Range:** 21-60
**Character:** Ruth Carter
**Competency:** 8/10 (medical expertise, pattern recognition)
**Current State:** Exhausted from Ch 16 emergency meeting, medical crisis mode activated

**Task:** Assess Ahdia's medical condition by overhearing treatment session through door

**Month:** 6
**Difficulty:** 7 (limited data, must infer from audio only, exhaustion penalty)

**Roll:** d10 = 6
**Total:** 6 + 8 (competency) = 14 vs DC 7
**Result:** CRITICAL SUCCESS (exceeded by 7)

### Outcome

Ruth doesn't just hear the numbers - she constructs complete exponential decay model:
- Week 1-4: 6% drop (sustainable pace)
- Week 5-8: 8% drop (concerning acceleration)
- Week 9-16: 12% drop (dangerous trajectory)
- Week 17-18: 14% drop (terminal trajectory visible)

Critical insight achieved: Next crash will be 18-20%, and at 30% baseline cellular integration becomes impossible. Treatment itself fails.

Ruth calculates: Ahdia has 3-7 days to live unless radical change.

### Cost Paid

Emotional toll - Ruth realizes she's watching best friend die by choice. Weight of responsibility: Ryu said she's "the only person Ahdia's still afraid of disappointing."

### Limitation Expressed

Can't save everyone - Ruth is expert diagnostician but can't force patient to accept care. Medical knowledge shows her exactly how Ahdia's dying but doesn't give her power to stop it.

### Character State Change

From "exhausted but determined" to "carrying impossible weight" - knows she must confront Ahdia with terminal prognosis.

## Scene 2: Persuading Ryu

**Beat Range:** 76-120
**Character:** Ruth Carter
**Competency:** 8/10 (medical colleague relationship, genuine concern, shared patient)
**Current State:** Carrying weight of terminal prognosis, needs confirmation/details

**Task:** Convince Dr. Ryu to break patient confidentiality and share Ahdia's full medical picture

**Month:** 6
**Difficulty:** 8 (patient confidentiality protocols strong, professional ethics, late night exhaustion)

**Roll:** d10 = 7
**Total:** 7 + 8 (competency) = 15 vs DC 8
**Result:** CRITICAL SUCCESS (exceeded by 7)

### Outcome

Ryu doesn't just share basics - provides complete medical picture:
- Full cellular baseline graphs showing exponential decay
- Timeline predictions (days to week if stops, 3-7 days if continues)
- Ahdia's lies to medical team (claims "Go Squad missions" but wasn't with them)
- Three treatments remaining (9 days if spaced, 3 days if current pace)
- Personal assessment: "You're the only person she's still afraid of disappointing"

Ryu's emotional state visible - defeated, grieving, knows he's watching patient choose death.

### Cost Paid

Responsibility - Ryu explicitly places burden of intervention on Ruth. He's tried and failed. Ruth now carries expectation she can succeed where he couldn't.

### Limitation Expressed

Professional boundaries - Ruth asking colleague to violate ethics. Success means Ryu trusted her judgment over protocols, but Ruth now complicit in confidentiality breach.

### Character State Change

From "needs information" to "armed with devastating truth and responsibility for using it" - can no longer claim ignorance, must act on knowledge.

## Scene 3: Setting Boundary

**Beat Range:** 161-205
**Character:** Ruth Carter
**Competency:** 7/10 (doctor's oath pulls toward caretaking, exhausted, but Book 1 lesson learned)
**Current State:** Confronting Ahdia, stating: "I can't keep providing treatment that enables you to kill yourself faster"

**Task:** Follow through on boundary - actually mean it when saying she won't provide treatment that enables self-destruction

**Month:** 6
**Difficulty:** 9 (goes against caretaking instinct, best friend relationship, guilt over refusing care, exhaustion)

**Roll:** d10 = 8
**Total:** 8 + 7 (competency) = 15 vs DC 9
**Result:** SUCCESS (exceeded by 6, strong success)

### Outcome

Ruth holds the line. Doesn't waver, doesn't soften boundary, doesn't offer compromise.

States clearly: "Next treatment is conditional on honesty about missions and sustainable limits. If you don't agree, I don't provide treatment."

Ahdia believes her - defensive walls crack because Ruth's resolve is visible. This isn't threat or manipulation, it's genuine limit-setting.

Conditions set:
- 72-hour minimum treatment spacing
- Stay local unless actual emergency
- Coordinate with team instead of solo missions

Ahdia agrees (exhausted, defeated, accepting).

### Cost Paid

Relationship strain - Ruth forcing best friend to choose between death and compliance. May damage friendship permanently. Guilt over "letting Ahdia die" if she refuses conditions.

### Limitation Expressed

Can't fix everyone - Ruth applying Book 1 lesson. Learned she can't save people from themselves. Can only set boundaries and let them choose. Even with medical expertise, can't force healing.

### Character State Change

From "trying to save Ahdia" to "accepting Ahdia must choose to save herself" - fundamental shift from fixer to boundary-setter. Growth from Book 1 mistake applied.
