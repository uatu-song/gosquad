## Scene 1: Ruth's Triage Moment (Months 7-8)

### Setup
- **Context:** Mass casualty event at Eidolon-amplified protest
- **Situation:** 30+ wounded, Ruth coordinating field medicine alone
- **Stakes:** CADENS wants evacuation, Go Squad scattered, life-or-death triage calls

### Character Framework
- **Competency:** Medical skills, tactical leadership, triage thinking (elite level)
- **Limitation:** Tries to fix/save everyone, can't accept losses
- **Cost:** Burnout, team autonomy, impossible responsibility

### Three-Axis Resolution

**1. Task Outcome: SUCCESS**
- Stabilizes 8 critical patients who would have died
- Efficient triage, perfect technique
- Coordinates volunteers effectively
- Sets up field hospital in 12 minutes

**2. Cost Paid: HIGH**
- Physical: 6 hours straight, hands shaking, dehydrated, exhausted
- Emotional: 4 people died while saving others, watched teenager bleed out 15 feet away
- Relational: CADENS furious (insubordination), used team supplies without asking, civilians expect miracles
- Professional: Broke protocol, legally exposed, traumatic memories

**3. Limitation Expressed: STRONG**
- After saving 8th patient, tries to save 9th (traumatic brain injury, clearly beyond help)
- Victor physically pulls her away, she fights him
- Breaks down: "I should have been faster. I should have—"
- Can't delegate even when volunteers offer
- Blames self for 4 deaths (impossible standard)
- Realizes she treats team same way (trying to save them from themselves)
- Can't accept: Some things can't be fixed
- Dissociates slightly (shock response to helplessness)

### Key Story Beats

1. **Opening:** Mid-crisis, Ruth working on arterial bleed, volunteers seeking guidance
2. **Success Montage:** Saving 8 critical patients, perfect execution
3. **The Cost:** Teenager dies 15 feet away while she's saving someone else
4. **The Break:** Tries to save unsaveable 9th patient, won't stop
5. **Physical Intervention:** Victor pulls her away, she fights him
6. **Collapse:** "I should have been faster!"
7. **Realization:** Sitting on curb, shaking, covered in blood - realizes she does this to the team
8. **Triage Truth:** Some people die while you're saving others. That's the job.
9. **Support:** Victor stays. Doesn't fix. Witnesses.
10. **Emotional Release:** Quiet, professional crying

### Thematic Function
- Medical triage → Leadership triage parallel
- Competency ≠ control
- "Can't save everyone" made visceral
- Sets up Phase 3-4 of Ruth's arc (acceptance → leading through chaos)

### Story Integration
- **Book 2 Timeline:** Months 7-8 (breaking point)
- **Arc Position:** Phase 2 → Phase 3 transition
- **Connects to:** Victor's teaching ("I create space, don't control outcomes")
- **Sets up:** Ruth applying triage thinking to team leadership
- **Eidolon context:** Protest violence amplified by fear manipulation

### Generated Prose (Raw Draft)

Ruth's hands moved automatically. Pressure here. Tourniquet there. The woman under her hands was maybe twenty-five, arterial bleed from thigh, going into shock.

"Stay with me," Ruth said. Clinical. Calm. She'd done this a thousand times in the ER.

Except the ER had backup. Equipment. Clean surfaces.

This was asphalt and screaming.

"Doctor Carter!" A volunteer—college kid, maybe, wearing a shredded protest shirt. "This one's—I don't know if—"

"Triage him," Ruth snapped. Not cruel. Efficient. "Red tag if he's critical, yellow if stable, black if—"

She didn't finish. The kid understood.

Eight people with red tags. Eight people who'd die without her.

She saved them. All eight. Perfect technique, perfect calls, perfect execution.

A teenager died fifteen feet away while she was elbow-deep in someone else's abdomen.

She'd made the right call. The math was clear: save the saveable, accept losses.

Her hands were still moving. Ninth patient. Traumatic brain injury. Unresponsive. Pupils blown.

Gone. Obviously gone.

But her hands wouldn't stop.

"Ruth." Victor's voice. Somewhere distant. "Ruth, he's gone."

"No." Her voice sounded strange. "I can—just need—more time—"

Victor's hands on her shoulders. Pulling her back.

She fought him. Actually fought him.

"I should have been faster!" The words ripped out of her. "I should have—"

And then she was sitting on the curb, hands shaking, covered in blood that belonged to four people she couldn't save and eight she could and one she'd wasted time on because she couldn't accept—

She couldn't accept—

"You saved eight people," Victor said quietly. Sitting beside her. Not touching. Just present.

"Four people died."

"You saved eight people who would have died without you."

Ruth looked at her hands. Still shaking.

She'd been trying to save the team the same way. Fix everything. Control outcomes. Save them from themselves.

Some things couldn't be fixed.

Some people died while you were saving others.

That was triage.

That was leadership.

That was the job.

She started crying. Quiet. Professional. Like everything else she did.

Victor stayed.

## Scene 2: Chapter 3 - Investigation (Month 1)

**CORRECTED VERSION** - Previous version had Ahdia "rewinding time" which is incorrect. She can only FREEZE or ACCELERATE time, never rewind.

**Full narrative beats:** See `/Book_2/Reference_Documents/Chapter_3_Investigation_CORRECTED.md`

### Setup
- **Context:** Day after Geneva Windrow assassination
- **Situation:** Go Squad investigates at CADENS facility with full resources
- **Stakes:** Find professional assassin, determine motive, prevent future attacks

### Character Framework (Three investigations)

**Ahdia:**
- Competency: Time powers, HUD analysis, crime scene investigation
- Limitation: Powers cost lifespan, avoidance/isolation
- Cost: Relationship friction, lifespan burned

**Ruth:**
- Competency: Medical examination, trauma surgery expertise
- Limitation: Grief over Firas unprocessed, emotional walls
- Cost: Emotional toll, suppressed feelings surface

**Ben:**
- Competency: Tactical analysis, satellite data
- Limitation: Pushed beyond comfort zone (investigator not soldier)
- Cost: Depression worsens, isolation deepens

### Three-Axis Resolution (TTRPG Generated)

**Ahdia's Investigation:**
- Roll: 2+2=4 vs difficulty 8 (significant failure)
- Task Outcome: SUCCESS WITH COMPLICATION (finds evidence but trail goes cold)
- Cost Paid: Relationship friction (team worried about her health, she isolates)
- Limitation: Powers cost lifespan (burns days holding 47-minute freeze)

**Ruth's Examination:**
- Roll: 3+3=6 vs difficulty 7 (narrow failure)
- Task Outcome: SUCCESS WITH COMPLICATION (identifies exotic ammunition but no ID)
- Cost Paid: Emotional toll (suppressed feelings surface)
- Limitation: Grief over Firas unprocessed (sees him on every table)

**Ben's Trace:**
- Roll: 4+2=6 vs difficulty 7 (narrow failure)
- Task Outcome: SUCCESS WITH COMPLICATION (finds staging area but dead end)
- Cost Paid: Depression worsens (isolation deepens)
- Limitation: Pushed beyond comfort zone (not his skillset)

### Key Story Beats

**Scene 1: CADENS Command Center**
1. Bourn offers resources to investigate (unofficial, off-books)
2. Three-pronged investigation established
3. Team friction: Leah worries about Ahdia's health, creates tension
4. Ahdia feels talked about behind back, isolates further

**Scene 2: Debate Hall - Crime Scene**
5. Ahdia FREEZES time (correct mechanic)
6. Uses HUD: zoom, thermal, EM spectrum, trajectory analysis
7. AR-Ryu talks to her in frozen time
8. Finds sniper position, brass casing, professional cleanup
9. Discovers: assassin used translocation to escape (CADENS-level tech)
10. Trail vanishes completely (impossible to trace)
11. Cost: Holds freeze 47 minutes, burns days of lifespan
12. Limitation: Chest pain intensifying, AR-Ryu warns her
13. Tess catches her when she unfreezes (47x force amplification makes her stumble)

**Scene 3: CADENS Medical Bay**
14. Ruth performs autopsy on Geneva Windrow
15. Victor present for moral support
16. Finds exotic ammunition (cataclysm-derived material)
17. Cost: Emotional walls crack, grief over Firas surfaces
18. Victor: "You're allowed to grieve and work. Both/and."
19. Ruth learning she doesn't have to be fixed to function

**Scene 4: Tactical Analysis**
20. Ben traces satellite/thermal data for 6 hours
21. Finds EM spike (staging area 3 blocks away)
22. But trail ends there (dead end)
23. Cost: Exhausted, snaps at Leah, isolation worsening
24. Limitation: Doing investigator work but he's a soldier (wrong skillset)

**Scene 5: Team Debrief**
25. Pool intelligence: professional hit, CADENS-level tech, cataclysm ammunition
26. Conclusion: state-level actor OR advanced private contractor
27. Kain connection theorized (benefits from Windrow's death)
28. Paranoia sets in: assassin has insider knowledge
29. Ruth (team leader): "She died for us. We finish this."
30. **CHAPTER END: Mysterious figure watches Ahdia from distance (AHDIA-PRIME)**

### Power Mechanics Used (CORRECTED)

✓ **Time Freeze** - Ahdia stops time, walks around frozen world
✓ **Duration** - 47 minutes frozen time = 0.003 seconds external
✓ **HUD Analysis** - 20x zoom, thermal overlays, EM spectrum, trajectory mapping
✓ **AR-Ryu** - Cybernetic consciousness talks to her in frozen time
✓ **Force Amplification** - 47x multiplier when unfreezing (makes her stumble)
✓ **Lifespan Cost** - Burns days/weeks for extended freezes
✓ **FAERIS Support** - Drones provide surveillance assistance
✓ **Translocation** - Assassin uses it (not Ahdia)

✗ **NO REWIND** - Never goes backward in time (ERROR CORRECTED)

### Thematic Function

**"You Don't Have to Be Fixed to Be Worthy":**
- They succeed at investigation despite being broken
- Ahdia functional while dying
- Ruth functional while grieving
- Ben functional while depressed
- Team fractured AND operational (both/and)

**Investigation Results:**
- ✓ Sniper position found
- ✓ Technology identified (translocation, cataclysm ammunition)
- ✓ Kain connection theorized
- ✗ Assassin identity unknown
- ✗ Trail completely cold

**Character Costs:**
- Ahdia: Burned days of lifespan, team friction
- Ruth: Emotional walls cracking, grief surfacing
- Ben: Pushed beyond limits, isolation deepening
- Team: Paranoia, trust issues, but staying together

### Story Integration

- **Book 2 Timeline:** Month 1 (opening chapters)
- **Arc Position:** Setup investigation thread
- **Connects to:**
  - Ben's Kain investigation (building evidence arc)
  - Ahdia-Prime mystery (watcher established)
  - Team dynamics (fractured but functional)
- **Sets up:**
  - Mysterious assassin (recurring threat or one-off?)
  - Kain as central antagonist
  - Paranoia/trust issues
  - Ahdia burning through lifespan too fast

**Status:** Narrative beats complete, ready for prose conversion

## Notes on TTRPG Generation Method

**Why This Works:**
- Forces competency success (characters are good at their thing)
- Generates unpredictable costs and limitation expressions
- Creates thematic tension automatically
- Both/and outcomes (success AND fracture)
- Surprise elements for both writer and AI

**How to Use:**
1. Set up character framework (competency/limitation/cost)
2. Establish scene context and stakes
3. Roll/determine three axes (Task/Cost/Limitation)
4. Let mechanical results drive narrative choices
5. Generate prose from the beats
6. Edit for voice, pacing, continuity

**Integration with Book 2:**
- Each scene maps to character arc phases from changelog
- Generated beats align with planned thematic moments
- System enforces "worthy while broken" mechanically
- Produces both/and outcomes naturally
