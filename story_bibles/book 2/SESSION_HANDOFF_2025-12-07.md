# Session Handoff - Book 2 Prose Development
**Date:** 2025-12-07 (Updated: End of Session)
**Purpose:** Preserve context for session continuity

---

## SESSION SUMMARY

### Infrastructure Completed (Earlier)
- Created `CHARACTER_STATE_INDEX.yaml` (1,063 lines)
- Expanded `METHOD_ACTOR_BRIEFING_DRAFT.md` with 5 new sections
- Expanded all 9 character arc trackers with chapter-by-chapter Book 2 detail
- Created `UPDATE_PROTOCOL.md` for maintaining trackers during prose

### Prose Generated (This Session)
- **Book 2 Chapter 1, Scene 1:** Beats 1-40 complete
- **Location:** `/workspaces/gosquad/book2_manuscript/chapter_01.md`
- **Word count:** ~420 lines, ~3,500 words
- **Status:** Scene 1 complete, Scene 2 (frozen time) ready to begin

---

## CHAPTER 1 PROGRESS

| Scene | Beats | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Scene 1: Peaceful Protest | Beats 1-40 | **COMPLETE** |
| Scene 2: Frozen Time - Crowd Control | Beats 41-80 | Not started |
| Scene 3: Aftermath - Medical Triage | Beats 81-130 | Not started |
| Scene 4: Go Squad Debrief | Beats 131-190 | Not started |

### Where We Left Off
Ahdia has translocated to the plaza center and frozen time. Scene 2 begins with her alone in frozen time, working to save people.

### Key Prose Decisions Made
1. **Ahdia's location:** Penthouse (watching via feeds), NOT rooftop with team. Beat sheet is scaffolding; prose is canon.
2. **Victor's roll (d20=10):** Partial success—saves civilians, takes hit, loses comms. Goes down fighting (4 cops, Krav Maga shown).
3. **Banter level:** Comic book energy added throughout.

---

## POWER MECHANICS CONFIRMED

**Critical understanding from Book 1 Chapter 16:**

1. Ahdia creates **temporal bubble/field** around team members (time dilation, not full freeze)
2. **FAERIS executes within that bubble**—drones provide actual effect
3. Each use costs Ahdia cellular degradation/lifespan
4. **Team activation triggers:**
   - Tess: Middle finger + eye-tracking → translocation
   - Ben: Crouch + jump → trajectory amplification
   - Leah: Battle cry + forward momentum → velocity multiplication
   - Victor: Grabbing gesture → force amplification

This is why the existing prose shows cold in Ahdia's chest when team repositions—she's creating temporal bubbles so FAERIS can work.

## FILES MODIFIED THIS SESSION

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `book2_manuscript/chapter_01.md` | Added beats 21-40 (~200 lines) |
| `story_bibles/book 2/SESSION_QUIZ_2025-12-07_DRAFT.md` | Added power mechanics questions (#15-16) |
| `story_bibles/book 2/SESSION_HANDOFF_2025-12-07.md` | This update |

---

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. **Continue Chapter 1 Scene 2:** Frozen time sequence (beats 41-80)
2. **Dice roll needed:** None for Scene 2 (outcome predetermined: SUCCESS with HIGH COST)
3. **Key moments in Scene 2:**
   - Ahdia saves 23 people
   - Specifically saves Korede (recognizes him)
   - Burns 47 MINUTES (not seconds) of frozen time
   - Nosebleed, physical deterioration shown

## COLLABORATION NOTES

- Beat sheet is scaffolding, prose is canon
- When uncertain about character actions, request dice roll
- User rolls the d20, provides the number
- Add comic book banter to dialogue
- Don't make up characters or details without consultation

---

## LLM TAKEAWAYS: OUR DYNAMIC

**What works:**
- User gives high-level direction, expects AI to execute and identify edge cases
- When I wasn't sure about something (Victor's action, power mechanics), asking for clarification or a dice roll kept us aligned
- User caught redundancy (Ben repeating the "not protesters" observation)—they read closely and expect tight prose
- User pushed for more banter ("think comic book")—this is a superhero story, not gritty realism

**What to avoid:**
- Don't assume details not in canon—I initially misunderstood where Ahdia was located (penthouse vs rooftop)
- Don't repeat character realizations within the same chapter
- Don't write characters as weak when they have established combat skills (Victor's Krav Maga)
- Don't run scripts without permission—user rolls dice, I wait for the value

**User's style:**
- Direct, efficient communication
- Corrects quickly when something's off ("Didn't Ben already clock that earlier?")
- Values consistency with established canon over beat sheet
- Expects me to add prose to documents, not just draft in conversation
- Wants infrastructure (quizzes, handoffs) maintained as we go

**Tone calibration:**
- Comic book banter in team dialogue
- Ahdia's voice: TV references, self-deprecating humor, rambling when stressed
- Action sequences: punchy, visual, not overwrought
- Keep momentum—don't over-describe
