# Session Handoff - 2025-12-09 (End of Session)

## What Was Accomplished

### CADENS Contractor Relationship Established

**Chapter 1, Scene 4 additions:**
- Ruth announces Bourn's offer post-riot
- Deal: New CADENS gear + Ahdia's treatment in exchange for deniable presence at "Geneva Convention" events
- Team reactions: Victor suspicious, Tess cynical about tracking devices, Ben tactical
- Ahdia acknowledges she's the reason Ruth made the deal
- First deployment = memorial in three days

**Chapter 2, Scene 1 revisions:**
- Geneva Convention protocol explained (CADENS designation for Geneva/Kain intersection events)
- EM anomalies spiking at every such event—riot was worst
- Ahdia as organic sensor—her Seed reacts to whatever's causing readings
- Personal motivation added: something wrong since riot, needs answers
- Ruth's check-in changed: "How's your chest?" not generic feelings
- Ahdia reports low-grade pressure, same flavor as riot
- Chest pulse beat added before "off like tomato" line

### Chapter 2 Scene 4 Written

**Treatment scene (Ryu/Ahdia):**
- Ryu notices autoinjector triggered her last time, counts down from three
- Quiet character moment—Ryu's care, Ahdia's shellshocked processing
- Geneva's "nowhere" speech discussed
- Ryu's Star Trek vulnerability (his version of pop culture as coping)
- Ends with unresolved question: "Is that enough?"
- Voice checklist applied: repetition loops, tangents, biased narrator, flat dark statements

### Chapter 2 Scene 5 Written (TTRPG Rolled)

**"The Night After" — Four POV beats with dice rolls:**

| Character | Roll | Result | Narrative Outcome |
|-----------|------|--------|-------------------|
| Ben | 19+7=26 vs DC15 | CRIT SUCCESS | Found CADENS-identical translocation signature—inside job |
| Tess | 9+8=17 vs DC15 | SUCCESS | Bot network activated 36 min BEFORE assassination—premeditation |
| Ahdia | 10+5-2=13 vs DC12 | SUCCESS (bare) | Third purple figure sighting, closer, looked directly at her |
| Ruth | 10+8=18 vs DC15 | SUCCESS | Synthesized pattern: CADENS involvement, ordered team silence |

**Key discoveries:**
- Translocation signature is IDENTICAL to CADENS tech (not similar—exact match)
- Narrative control was pre-positioned before Geneva died
- Purple figure has now appeared THREE times, each closer
- Ruth ordered: "Nobody talks about this outside the team. Not to CADENS. Not to Bourn."

### Voice Protocol Reminder

**Load order for prose generation:**
1. SESSION_HANDOFF (this file)
2. Ahdia_voice_sample.md (PART 7: Narrator Voice)
3. SCENE_GENERATION_TEMPLATE.md
4. Relevant manuscript chapter(s)
5. Character profiles for characters in scene

**Do not freehand prose without loading context first.**

**TTRPG Integration:**
- Method actor dialogue FIRST, prose wraps around it
- Roll outcomes determine what characters discover/experience
- Dice add productive uncertainty to investigation/perception scenes

## Current Manuscript State

### Chapter 1: The Riot (Complete)
- Scene 1-2: Protest → riot → 47-minute freeze
- Scene 3: CADENS medical, Ryu gets AR upload
- Scene 4: Penthouse debrief + CADENS deal announcement + purple figure sighting (1st)

### Chapter 2: The Assassination (Scenes 1-5 Complete)
- Scene 1: Memorial setup, Geneva Convention protocol, chest pressure
- Scene 2: Geneva's speech → assassination → 40-second freeze (saves 3)
- Scene 3: Fragments—Ben reports translocation, purple figure second sighting, car ride
- Scene 4: Treatment—Ryu/Ahdia quiet moment, autoinjector countdown
- Scene 5: The Night After—Ben/Tess/Ahdia/Ruth parallel beats, CADENS conspiracy revealed

---

## Character State (Chapter 2 Scene 5 End)

- **Ahdia baseline:** 59%
- **Location:** Penthouse, didn't sleep, watched rooftops until dawn
- **Emotional:** Exhausted, haunted by purple figure, processing Geneva's death
- **Knowledge:** Doesn't know about CADENS connection yet (wasn't on the call)

- **Ben:** At CADENS lab, has evidence of inside job, reported to Ruth
- **Tess:** Her apartment, found premeditation proof (36-minute gap), reported to Ruth
- **Ruth:** Synthesized both findings, suspects CADENS involvement, ordered silence
- **Ryu:** Left penthouse around midnight, not present for Scene 5

### Team Knowledge State
- **Ruth, Ben, Tess KNOW:** CADENS tech used, narrative pre-positioned, possible inside job
- **Ahdia, Victor, Leah DON'T KNOW YET:** The CADENS connection

---

## Purple Figure Tracker

| Sighting | Location | Details |
|----------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Ch1 Sc4: Rooftop across plaza | Purple lightning, vanished when Ahdia looked away |
| 2 | Ch2 Sc3: Parking structure | Watching her, purple flicker around hands |
| 3 | Ch2 Sc5: Building with green water tower | CLOSER, looked directly at Ahdia, vanished on blink |

**Pattern:** Appears after Ahdia uses powers or is exhausted. Getting closer each time. Seems to be watching HER specifically.

## Continuity Notes

### New Elements Introduced This Session

- **Geneva Convention protocol** — CADENS internal designation
- **EM anomalies** — Spike when Geneva/Kain intersect (seeds Eidolon reveal)
- **Ahdia as sensor** — Her Seed reacts to whatever causes anomalies
- **Chest pressure** — Low-grade since riot, same flavor, pulsed at memorial
- **New CADENS gear** — Not repaired, resupplied (better than stolen)
- **Ryu countdown accommodation** — He noticed her trigger, adapted
- **CADENS inside job evidence** — Identical translocation signature
- **Premeditation proof** — Bot network live 36 min before assassination
- **Ruth's silence order** — Team doesn't trust CADENS/Bourn now

### Assignments Given (Chapter 1)
- Ben: Provocateur thread (names, funding) — NOW: analyzing assassination evidence
- Tess: Social media bot pattern tracing — FOUND: premeditation
- Leah: Activist network warnings — status unknown

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Ahdia learns about CADENS connection** — Ruth needs to brief her
2. **Team regroup with full information** — Everyone in same room
3. **Decide: confront Bourn or investigate quietly?** — Major decision point
4. **Purple figure mystery** — Does Ahdia tell anyone about the sightings?
5. **Continue TTRPG integration** — Roll for uncertain outcomes
