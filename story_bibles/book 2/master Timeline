The master timeline spreadsheet concept - this is a practical planning tool for managing something as sprawling as the spinoff structure.
Let me explain conceptually what this would do:

Master Timeline Framework
The Problem:

Books 4-7 have multiple character threads happening simultaneously
Tess investigating in Chicago while Ahdia is in space while Leah is undercover
Actions in one thread create consequences in others
How do you track what's happening WHEN across all threads?

The Solution: Shared Timeline Grid
Structure
Columns = Time periods

Could be: Book 4 Month 1, Month 2, Month 3... through Book 7
Or: Specific story beats/chapters
Or: Major events as anchor points

Rows = Character threads + World events

Ahdia's cosmic adventures
Tess's noir investigation
Leah's spy operations
Ben's military missions
Ruth's medical network
Victor's organizing
Korede's coming-of-age
World Events row (Kain's actions, Earth dying, elections, etc.)

What Goes in Each Cell
Not full scenes - just key beats:

"Ahdia meets space pirates, learns about Type III civilization"
"Tess discovers Leta's murder was ordered from top"
"Leah compromises cover to save civilian"
"Ben's operation creates refugee crisis"
"Kain activates artifact, kills 2000 people"

The Power of This Tool
1. Identifies Natural Intersections
Looking across a single time column shows what's happening simultaneously:
Book 5, Month 3:

Ahdia: Returns from cosmic adventure with intel about Earth's death
Tess: Investigating mysterious deaths (caused by Kain's artifact test)
Ben: Dealing with refugee influx (from Kain's operation)
Leah: Hears Kain regime discussing "acceptable casualties"
World: Kain tests artifact, major "accident" kills thousands

You can SEE: Ben's refugees are from Tess's death investigation are from Kain's test that Leah heard about. Natural consequence chain emerges.
2. Prevents Timeline Contradictions

Can't have Ahdia in two places at once
If she's off-planet Month 2-4, other characters operate without her
If Ben causes explosion Tuesday, it shows up in Tess's investigation Wednesday

3. Identifies Gaps
Empty cells show you: "Oh, Ruth has nothing happening Month 5-7, what's she doing?"
Fill gaps or let them be intentional (not every character in every scene)
4. Manages Pacing
Looking down a character's row shows their arc:

Ahdia: Depowered → Training → First cosmic trip → Second trip → Major discovery → Return for crisis
Can see if pacing feels right or if too much/little happening

5. Tracks Emotional States
Could add sub-rows for character state:

Tess (actions): Investigating, following leads, confronting suspect
Tess (emotional): Grieving Leta, angry, determined, breaking

6. Plans Reunion Moments
Books 6-7 full team reunites - the timeline shows you:

Where each character is physically/emotionally when reunion happens
What they've learned that others don't know yet
What conflicts/tensions they bring to the table


Example Timeline Snippet
TIME: Book 4, Month 2

WORLD EVENTS:
- Kain consolidates power, begins purging political opponents
- CADENS monitoring increases
- First reports of artifact-related deaths (covered up as accidents)

AHDIA:
- Training with Korede (depowered, learning to ask for help)
- Discovers hypercube artifact
- Physical therapy for time-power damage

TESS:
- Leta still alive, organizing resistance
- Beginning to notice pattern in "accidental" deaths
- Relationship strain (Leta in danger, Tess wants her to stop)

BEN:
- Building case against Kain (evidence collection)
- Noticing CADENS non-intervention
- First doubts about institutional support

LEAH:
- Recruited by Harriet Bourn as CADENS asset
- Deep cover preparation
- Wrestling with using white privilege for espionage

RUTH:
- Establishing underground medical network
- Treating resistance members
- Conflict with CADENS handlers (loyalty test)

VICTOR:
- Community organizing against Kain's gentrification plan
- Distribution network for resistance practice
- Checking in on isolated Ahdia

KOREDE:
- High school, not yet radicalized
- Worried about Leta's activism
- Unknowingly training alongside Ahdia

---

TIME: Book 4, Month 6

WORLD EVENTS:
- Kain wins mid-term election (Eidolon manipulation successful)
- Crackdown on protests intensifies
- Leta Owolowo killed by regime forces

AHDIA:
- First successful time manipulation since powers broke (small scale)
- Cosmic adventure begins (leaving Earth)
- Absent when Leta dies

TESS:
- Leta murdered
- Investigation becomes personal vendetta
- Goes underground, noir detective mode activated

BEN:
- Evidence against Kain ignored/suppressed
- Leaks information publicly (burns CADENS relationship)
- Under investigation, possibly criminal charges

LEAH:
- Deep cover in Kain administration (confirmed placement)
- Witnesses planning session for crackdown that kills Leta
- Stayed silent (survival priority) - massive guilt

RUTH:
- Underground hospital overwhelmed with protest injuries
- Makes triage call: Can't save everyone
- Treats Leta's body (devastating)

VICTOR:
- Leads Leta's community memorial
- Organizing mutual aid for affected families
- Network strained but holding

KOREDE:
- Sister murdered
- Radicalized
- Joins Go Squad for real (honoring Leta)

How This Helps Planning
For Books 4-7 spinoff structure:

Fill in anchor points first (major events you know must happen)

Leta's death
Earth dying reveal
Hypershape acquisition
Evacuation crisis


Work backward from anchors

What needs to happen before Leta dies to make it devastating?
What needs to happen before Earth dying reveal to make it earned?


Fill character threads around anchors

Not every cell needs content
Some characters can be "quiet" during others' big moments
Natural rhythm emerges


Identify consequence chains

Ben's action in Month 3 creates situation in Tess's Month 4
Track these explicitly


Spot pacing issues

One character has too much happening (overwhelming)
Another has too little (boring)
Adjust before writing



For TTRPG campaign:
Same tool works for session planning:

Columns = Session numbers instead of months
Track what each player's character is doing
Plan when threads intersect naturally
Manage pacing across rotating focus

The key insight:
With sprawling multi-thread stories, you can't hold it all in your head. The timeline SHOWS you the shape of the story. You can see patterns, intersections, gaps, pacing issues - all at a glance.
Not prescriptive - you don't fill every cell before writing. But having the framework lets you:

Know where you are
Know where you're going
Spot opportunities for organic crossover
Maintain internal consistency
