The debate started at 7 PM sharp.

Geneva Windrow took the podium first—tall, composed, the kind of presence that made you sit up straighter without knowing why. She wore a navy suit that probably cost more than Ahdia's monthly food budget, but she didn't wear it like armor. She wore it like work clothes. Like she had a job to do.

"Three days ago," Geneva said, "Caledonia witnessed tragedy."

The hall went quiet. Not the polite quiet of an audience waiting for applause lines. The heavy quiet of people who knew what was coming.

"A man named Daniel Okonkwo died in a protest turned violent. He was thirty-one years old. An accountant."

She looked down at her notes. Touched the edge of the paper. Didn't read from it.

"I have a speech prepared. My team worked very hard on it. Polling data, policy proposals, a really excellent pivot to my infrastructure plan." A small, tired smile. "They're going to be upset with me."

She stepped out from behind the podium. The stage lights followed her, harsh and unforgiving.

"I visited Daniel's mother yesterday. Gloria Okonkwo. She lives in a two-bedroom apartment in Eastwick with photographs covering every wall. I was supposed to stay fifteen minutes. Photo op, condolences, back to the motorcade. That's how these things work. You learn to schedule grief in increments."

Geneva stopped at the edge of the stage. Closer to the audience than any handler would have approved.

"I stayed three hours."

Someone in the crowd shifted. A cough. Otherwise, silence.

"Gloria showed me Daniel's room. He still lived with her—was saving up for a down payment on a condo, she said. Wanted to stay close. She showed me his desk where he did freelance accounting on weekends. Showed me his bookshelf. He liked science fiction. Asimov, Butler, Le Guin. His copies were worn soft at the spines."

Ahdia felt something in her chest that wasn't the Seed. Something older. More ordinary.

"And then she showed me his trains."

Geneva's voice caught. Just slightly. She didn't try to hide it.

"Daniel built model trains. Had a whole layout in his spare bedroom—mountains made of papier-mâché, tunnels he'd carved himself, a little town with a bakery and a church and a barbershop with a tiny striped pole. Twelve years he'd been working on it. Since college. His mother said he'd come home from work and spend hours in that room. Said it was the only time he really relaxed."

She stopped. Pressed her lips together. Took a breath.

"Gloria asked if I wanted to see it run. So I sat in her dead son's bedroom, in his desk chair that still had his jacket hanging on the back, and I watched his trains go around the track. The little town. The mountains. The tunnel he carved when he was twenty years old. Around and around."

The hall was absolutely still. Ahdia had stopped scanning for threats. Everyone had stopped everything.

"We sat there for twenty minutes. She held my hand. We didn't say anything. There was nothing to say."

Geneva looked up at the lights. Blinked. Looked back at the audience.

"My advisors told me not to talk about this. They said it's not strategic. They said voters want to see strength, confidence, solutions. They said—" She laughed, short and humorless. "They said 'don't cry on stage, it polls badly with independents.'"

A murmur in the crowd. Not disapproval. Recognition.

"Here's what I'm not supposed to tell you."

She moved back toward the podium but didn't stand behind it. Leaned against it instead, like she was tired. Like the performance had become too heavy to carry.

"I don't know what policy would have saved Daniel Okonkwo. I've been doing this for twenty-two years. I've written legislation, I've chaired committees, I've given more speeches than I can count. And I sat in that bedroom with Gloria and I didn't have a single answer for her. Not one."

Ahdia's throat was tight. She thought about the riot. The forty-seven minutes. The math that would never balance.

"Harding Kain is going to stand at this podium in a few minutes and tell you Daniel died because we don't have enough police. Because protesters are dangerous. Because order must be maintained." Geneva's voice hardened, but it wasn't politician-hard. It was the hardness of someone who'd seen something they couldn't unsee. "He's going to use that man's death—that quiet man who built model trains and read science fiction and lived with his mother because he loved her—as a talking point. A pivot. A line in a stump speech."

She shook her head.

"I've done it too. I've stood at podiums and said names of dead people and pivoted to policy. That's the job. You learn to metabolize tragedy into messaging. You learn to—"

She stopped. Something crossed her face. Decision.

"I'm so tired."

The words came out soft. Unguarded. Not meant for a microphone, but the microphone caught them anyway.

"I'm so tired of being strategic about dead people. I'm tired of calculating how much grief to show. I'm tired of—" She gestured vaguely. "This. All of it. The performance."

Ahdia felt frozen, and not in the way she could control. This wasn't a speech anymore. This was someone unraveling at a podium, on live television, in front of two thousand people and however many million watching at home.

Geneva straightened. Smoothed her jacket. When she spoke again, her voice was steadier, but the rawness was still there underneath.

"Daniel's girlfriend is still in the hospital. Maya. She has a broken collarbone and three fractured ribs from being trampled. She's twenty-nine years old. They were going to get engaged next month—Gloria showed me the ring. He'd been carrying it around for weeks, waiting for the right moment."

She looked directly into the camera. Not performing for it. Looking through it.

"Maya's going to wake up and Daniel won't be there. There's no policy for that. There's no legislation that fixes that. There's no five-point plan that brings him back to finish his trains or give her that ring or—"

Her voice broke. She let it.

"I don't have answers tonight. I know that's not what you want to hear. I know you came here for a debate, for zingers and soundbites, for someone to tell you they've got it all figured out."

She wiped her eye with the back of her hand. Didn't try to hide it.

"I don't have it figured out. What I have is Gloria Okonkwo's phone number in my pocket because I promised I'd call her tomorrow. What I have is a lot of doubt and not enough sleep and the memory of watching a dead man's trains go around a track while his mother held my hand."

Geneva looked at Kain's empty podium. Then back at the audience.

"But I have something else too."

Her voice changed. Not harder—deeper. Like she was reaching for something she didn't usually say out loud.

"I have a vision. And I'm going to share it with you tonight, even though my team is going to kill me, even though it's not polling-tested or focus-grouped, even though it sounds—" She paused. "Even though it sounds impossible."

She stepped forward again. Away from the podium entirely now. Standing at the very edge of the stage, close enough that people in the front row could have touched her.

"I see a world."

The words hung there. Simple. Strange.

"I see a world where Gloria Okonkwo doesn't have to choose between paying rent and paying for her diabetes medication. Where Daniel didn't have to work weekends doing freelance accounting just to save for a down payment on a modest home. Where Maya doesn't wake up to medical bills that will bankrupt her before she's finished grieving."

Geneva's eyes were distant now. Focused on something the audience couldn't see.

"I see a world where everyone has enough. Not the same—we're not the same, we don't want the same things—but *enough*. Enough food. Enough shelter. Enough medicine. Enough security to build model trains in your spare bedroom without wondering if you'll lose everything to one bad month."

Ahdia felt something stir in her chest. Not the Seed. Not grief. Something like... hunger. Like hearing someone describe a meal when you'd forgotten you were starving.

"Some people call that socialism. Some people call it naive. Some people call it—" Geneva smiled, a little sadly. "—unrealistic. But I've sat with Gloria Okonkwo, and I've sat with families in Appalachia and the South Side and rural Oregon, and I'm telling you: they're not asking for the moon. They're asking for *enough*."

She began to pace. Slow. Thoughtful. Like she was working something out in real-time.

"But enough isn't enough. I know that. Because I've also sat with artists who feel like their work doesn't matter. With entrepreneurs who feel suffocated by bureaucracy. With young people who want to build something new and keep being told to wait their turn."

Her voice lifted. Found a new register.

"I see a world where we have enough AND we have freedom. Where the baseline is security, but the ceiling is infinite. Where you're not one medical bill away from ruin, so you can actually take risks. Start that business. Make that art. Say what you actually think without worrying about losing your health insurance."

Ahdia noticed Kain shifting in the wings. His face was still arranged in that polite attention, but something flickered behind it. Irritation? No. Something colder.

"The lie they tell us," Geneva said, "is that we have to choose. Security or freedom. Equality or excellence. Taking care of each other or letting people fly. But that's a lie told by people who benefit from us fighting over scraps."

She stopped pacing. Faced the audience directly.

"Daniel Okonkwo built model trains. He also did freelance accounting on weekends and read science fiction and went to protests and lived with his mother. He contained multitudes. We all do. And a society that forces us to choose—that makes us pick one part of ourselves and abandon the rest—that's not a society. That's a prison with better marketing."

A ripple through the crowd. Shifting. Leaning forward.

"I see a world where the artist and the engineer sit at the same table. Where the risk-taker and the caretaker aren't enemies. Where we stop pretending that my freedom to swing my fist has to end at your nose—where we build a world with enough *room* that we don't have to constantly negotiate whose dreams matter more."

Her voice was building now. Finding something approaching fervor, but grounded. Real.

"I see a world where we take care of the vulnerable. Not because they're useful. Not because they might become productive. Because they're *people*. Because a society is measured by how it treats those who can't fight back. The disabled. The elderly. The children. The sick. The different. The difficult."

She paused. Her eyes found someone in the audience—a woman in a wheelchair near the aisle.

"I see you," Geneva said, directly to her. "And in the world I'm describing, you wouldn't have to fight so hard just to exist."

The woman's hand went to her mouth. Her companion's arm around her shoulders.

"But here's the part that keeps me up at night."

Geneva's voice dropped. Quieter now. More intimate, despite the microphones, despite the cameras, despite the two thousand people hanging on every word.

"It's not enough to have enough. It's not enough to be free. It's not enough to be taken care of. We need something else. Something harder to name."

She touched her chest. Right over her heart.

"We need it to *mean* something."

The hall was so quiet Ahdia could hear the electrical hum of the stage lights.

"I've met people who have everything. Money, security, freedom, health. And they're *empty*. I've met people who have nothing—nothing material, nothing secure—and they're the most alive humans I've ever encountered. Because they have *purpose*. They have *struggle*. They have something to push against."

She shook her head slowly.

"This is the part that scares me. Because I want to end suffering. I want to end poverty and disease and violence and all the thousand ways we break each other. But I also know—I *know*—that some part of us needs the struggle. Needs the challenge. Needs the possibility of failure to make success mean anything."

Ahdia's breath caught. This wasn't a campaign speech anymore. This was something else. Something that felt almost dangerous.

"How do you build a world where no one *has* to suffer, but everyone still has the chance to *strive*? Where we've solved the problems that destroy people, but we haven't solved away the problems that *make* people? Where we've ended the meaningless pain but kept the meaningful challenges?"

Geneva laughed softly. At herself, it seemed.

"I don't know. I really don't. Maybe it's impossible. Maybe we're built for scarcity and we'd fall apart in abundance. Maybe we need our brokenness more than we know."

She looked up. Something fierce in her eyes now.

"But I refuse to accept that. I refuse to believe that the only way humanity works is if most of us are suffering. I refuse to tell Gloria Okonkwo that her son had to die for some cosmic balance to be maintained. That's not a society. That's a sacrifice machine, and we're all just fuel."

Her voice rose. Found its full power.

"I believe—I have to believe—that we can build something better. Something that keeps the struggle without requiring the suffering. Something that gives everyone enough without making anyone empty. Something that—"

She stopped. Smiled. A real smile, the first one of the night.

"Something that lets a quiet man build model trains in his spare bedroom, and take risks when he's ready, and be taken care of when he falls, and find meaning in all of it. Without needing to die at thirty-one to remind us that life matters."

The applause started. Not the polite debate applause. Something rawer. Wetter. People crying and clapping at the same time. People who had forgotten they were at a political event and remembered they were humans watching another human say true things out loud.

Geneva raised her hand. The applause faded. She had one more thing to say.

"I know this sounds like a dream. I know my opponent is going to call me a utopian. And maybe he's right. Maybe the world I'm describing can't exist. Maybe Thomas More was right and *utopia* really does mean *nowhere*—the place that can't be."

She stepped back toward the podium. Put her hands on its edges. Leaned forward like she was telling a secret to two thousand people.

"But I'd rather spend my life reaching for nowhere than accept that this—" She gestured. At the hall. At everything. At the whole broken world. "—that this is the best we can do. I'd rather fail trying to build something beautiful than succeed at maintaining something ugly."

She straightened. Found her formal voice again, but it was different now. Softer. Like the performance was finally aligned with the person.

"Daniel Okonkwo went to that protest because he believed showing up mattered. He believed that bodies in the street could change things. That visibility was power."

Her voice cracked slightly. She let it.

"He was right. It does matter. It can change things. That's why people like Harding Kain work so hard to make it dangerous."

She looked out at the audience. Two thousand faces. Some crying. Some stone-faced. Some leaning forward like they'd never heard a politician speak before. Like they'd forgotten politicians *could* speak like this.

"I can't bring Daniel back. I can't promise you I'll build the world I just described. I can't even promise I'll win this election." A ghost of a smile. "My advisors are definitely firing me after this."

A ripple of laughter. Wet, uncomfortable, relieved.

"What I can promise is this: if you give me the chance, I will never stop reaching for that world. I will never accept that suffering is necessary. I will never—"

The pressure in Ahdia's chest spiked.

Her HUD flickered—EM readings spiking hard, same pattern as the riot, stronger now, much stronger. The hum behind her sternum was almost painful. She opened her mouth to say something, to warn—

"—I will never forget that Daniel Okonkwo built model trains, and read science fiction, and loved his mother, and went to a protest because he believed—he *believed*—"

The window behind the stage exploded inward.

No—not exploded. Something went *through* it. Something fast. Something that made a sound like a whip crack and a wet thud at the same time.

Geneva's head snapped back.

For a fraction of a second—a frozen instant that Ahdia would remember for the rest of her life—Geneva Windrow was still standing. Still mid-word. Still reaching toward the audience with one hand like she could touch them, like she could close the distance between podium and people, between politician and human being, between the broken world and the beautiful one she'd been describing.

*—he believed—*

Then gravity remembered her.

Blood. A spray of it, fine as mist, catching the stage lights. Making them shimmer red and gold.

Skull fragments. White and red and things that shouldn't be outside a body, catching the light like terrible confetti.

She dropped. Not dramatically, not cinematically. Just... dropped. Like a marionette with cut strings. Like a person becoming a thing. Her body hit the podium, knocked it sideways, knocked her notes into the air—pages scattering, white rectangles floating down like leaves while her body hit the floor with a sound that was somehow worse than the gunshot.

The thud of meat. The thud of something that used to be a person and now was just weight and mass and cooling cells.

The hall didn't scream. Not yet.

For three seconds—maybe four—maybe a lifetime—two thousand people sat in their velvet seats and didn't breathe. The silence was physical, a pressure, a vacuum where sound should be. Where the rest of her sentence should be. Where the beautiful world she'd been describing should be.

Ahdia could hear the buzz of the stage lights. The creak of someone's chair. The soft flutter of Geneva's notes settling on the blood-wet floor. The distant hum of the HVAC system, doing its job, circulating air through a room where air no longer seemed to exist.

Geneva Windrow's blood spread across the polished wood floor. Slow. Patient. Taking its time. Like it didn't know the urgency was over. Like it didn't know she was gone.

Her hand was still extended. Still reaching. For the audience. For the world she'd described. For nowhere.

*I'd rather spend my life reaching for nowhere than accept that this is the best we can do.*

That was the promise. That was what she'd been building toward. And now she was a body on a stage, and her nowhere was exactly as far away as it had always been, and her notes were soaking red at the edges, and her hand was still reaching.

The woman in the wheelchair in the front row was staring. Mouth open. Hand still at her face where she'd touched it when Geneva had seen her. Had said *I see you*.

No one saw her now. Everyone was looking at the body.

Daniel Okonkwo. Gloria. The model trains. The ring Maya would never receive. The world where everyone had enough and everyone was free and everyone found meaning without suffering.

All of it. Gone. Mid-sentence. Mid-thought. Mid-reach.

And somewhere in the wings, Harding Kain stood perfectly still, hands clasped in front of him, face arranged in what would later be described as "shock" but looked, to Ahdia, in that frozen moment, like something else entirely.

Like satisfaction.

Like a man who had been waiting for his turn at a buffet, and finally, finally, it was time to eat.

Then someone in the front row started screaming, and the silence shattered, and two thousand people remembered how to move and breathe and panic, and the beautiful nowhere Geneva Windrow had been reaching for collapsed into chaos, into terror, into the ugly world she'd refused to accept.

And Ahdia stood in the wings, EM readings spiking, chest burning, watching the future bleed out on a polished wood floor.

She'd saved twenty-three people three days ago.

She hadn't saved anyone tonight.
