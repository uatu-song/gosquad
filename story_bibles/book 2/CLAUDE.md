# CLAUDE.md - Book 2

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working on Book 2 of the Auerbach Series.

## Book 2 Overview

**Status:** Planning / Pre-production

**Emotional Arc:** Sacrifice everything → Win through vulnerability

**Thematic Focus:** CBT approach continuing to fail - Ahdia learns strength through vulnerability

**Chess Structure:** TBD - Game selection in progress

## Book 2A/2B Split

Book 2 is split into two parts:
- **Book 2A:** Chapters 1-19, ends with Ruth discovering Exile Island
- **Book 2B:** Chapters 20+, ends with Kain winning election, Prime reveals herself

This naming avoids renumbering the 7-book series.

## Where to Find Information

### Critical Reference Documents

**Before writing ANY prose, consult these in order:**

1. **`/story_bibles/book 2/BOOK2A_CONTINUITY_TRACKER.md`** - CHARACTER STATES, SEED TRACKING, TIMELINE
   - Ahdia's baseline numbers (must be consistent)
   - Who knows what, when
   - Seeds planted → when they bloom
   - "Why didn't you save her?" undercurrent tracking

2. **`/story_bibles/book 2/Chapter_X_STRUCTURE.md`** - SCENE BEATS
   - Detailed beat-by-beat scene breakdowns
   - Exists for all 24 chapters

3. **`/story_bibles/book 2/Chapter_X_METHOD_ACTOR.md`** - DIALOGUE/VOICE (if exists)
   - `[NARRATOR]` / `[AS CHARACTER]` formatted scenes
   - Completed for Ch 3-6, voice-critical scenes only thereafter

4. **`/story_bibles/book 2/METHOD_ACTOR_BRIEFING_DRAFT.md`** - CHARACTER VOICE CARDS
   - How each character speaks, thinks, reacts
   - Performance notes for dialogue scenes

### The Tragedy Engine

Book 2 is a tragedy engine. Every chapter plants seeds for devastation:
- **Leta's death** (Month 11, killed by Webb)
- **Ben's breakdown** (Month 8, evidence fails)
- **Ruth's institutional capture** (Bourn grooming arc)
- **Ahdia's benevolent dictator arc** (Exile Island)

Underneath it all: **"Why didn't you save her?"** - the question the reader doesn't know is being asked.

## Educational Mission (New for Book 2+)

**Goal:** Make series educational, not just sci-fi action

**Approach:**
- Use Ahdia as layperson stand-in to explain complex science
- **Anchor → Struggle → Resolution** method for each concept
- Minimize cognitive load through familiar analogies
- Create emotionally safe learning environment

**Key Concepts to Introduce in Book 2:**
- Kardashev Scale (humanity at Type 0.72)
- Social comparison psychology (Kain's cosmic inferiority complex)
- Advanced technology (quantum computing, fusion, FAERIS AI evolution)
- Political psychology (authoritarianism, comparison as "thief of joy")
- Great Filter theory (psychological, not technological)

**Educational Resources:**
- `/Writing_Guide/Educational_Design/Teaching_Complex_Science.md` - Complete pedagogical framework
- `/Themes/Educational Ecosystem Framework` - Strategic vision for education through narrative
- `/Themes/dreamboard` - Cutting-edge science concepts ("Lego parts" section)

**Remember:** Ahdia's confusion makes learning safe. Her breakthroughs = reader's "aha" moments.

## Character Voice System

### Ahdia Bacchus (Protagonist POV)

Ahdia's voice remains consistent across all books, but evolves subtly as she grows.

**Note:** "Auerbach" is her CADENS-issued codename, used only in operational contexts or by official agencies.

**Core Identity (Book 2):**
- Still depressed hermit, but forced into more action
- TV still primary frame of reference
- Powers becoming more familiar but costs escalating
- Learning vulnerability might be strength (reluctantly)

**Voice Patterns:**
```
✓ Casual/contemporary language ("What the actual hell?")
✓ Self-correction pattern: "[Statement]. Or rather, [correction]?"
✓ Rambling run-ons when stressed
✓ Deadpan acceptance of absurd situations
✓ TV/movie processing of real events
✓ Specific details over generic descriptions
```

**For complete voice guidelines, see:**
- `/Writing_Guide/Voice_and_Style/Ahdia_Voice_Checklist.md`
- `Book_1/Reference_Documents/CLAUDE.md` (established baseline)

## Chess Structure Implementation

### When Working on Chapters

1. **Locate the chess game** for Book 2 in `/Writing_Guide/Chess_Structure/CHESS_GAMES_COLLECTION.md`
2. **Identify critical moves** (3-5 key turning points in the game)
3. **Map emotional arc** from chess position to character state
4. **Flexible ratio:** Some moves = multiple chapters; some chapters = multiple moves
5. **Trust the pacing** inherent in the game structure

**For complete chess methodology, see:**
- `/Writing_Guide/Chess_Structure/CHESS_TO_NARRATIVE_MAPPING_PROCESS.md`

## Seven-Book Context

Book 2 is part of the "CBT approach failing" arc (Books 1-3).

**Book 1:** Avoidance → Forced action ✓ (Complete)
**Book 2:** Sacrifice/vulnerability → Unexpected strength ← You are here
**Book 3:** Confidence → Psychological collapse
**Book 4:** Turning point (stalemate, DBT introduction)
**Books 5-7:** DBT approach succeeding

**Thematic Core:** You don't have to be fixed to be worthy

## Common Tasks

### Writing Prose for a Chapter

**Pre-flight checklist:**

1. **Check continuity tracker** (`BOOK2A_CONTINUITY_TRACKER.md`)
   - What is Ahdia's baseline this chapter?
   - What does each character know at this point?
   - What seeds are being planted? What seeds are blooming?
   - How does "why didn't you save her?" manifest?

2. **Read the structure file** (`Chapter_X_STRUCTURE.md`)
   - Scene-by-scene beats
   - Touchpoints A→B for each scene
   - TTRPG dice results if applicable

3. **Check for Method Actor draft** (`Chapter_X_METHOD_ACTOR.md`)
   - If exists: Use for dialogue, voice, emotional calibration
   - If doesn't exist: Reference `METHOD_ACTOR_BRIEFING_DRAFT.md` for character voices

4. **Write prose** referencing structure, maintaining voice consistency

5. **Post-flight: Update continuity tracker** if any state changes occurred

### Voice-Critical Scenes

Some scenes need extra dialogue/voice calibration. Method Actor scaffolds exist for:
- Ch 3-6 (complete)
- Ch 10 (Victor teaches but/and - dialogue heavy)
- Ch 17 (Ruth/Ahdia confrontation - emotional climax)
- Ch 19 (Exile Island discovery - Both/And complexity)

For other dialogue-heavy scenes, reference `METHOD_ACTOR_BRIEFING_DRAFT.md` character voice cards.

### Starting New Chapters (Legacy)

1. Consult `/Story_Bible/` for canon
2. Check `/Character_Profiles/` for character arcs
3. Reference chess structure for pacing
4. Maintain Ahdia's voice (check `/Writing_Guide/Voice_and_Style/Ahdia_Voice_Checklist.md`)
5. Ground cosmic elements in casual language

### Revising Chapters

1. Check voice against Ahdia checklist
2. Verify chess position alignment
3. Ensure pop culture references reveal isolation
4. Confirm thematic beats align with Book 2 arc
5. Test dialogue by reading aloud
6. **Cross-check continuity tracker for consistency**

## Quality Checks

### Before Finalizing Any Scene

- [ ] Sounds like someone who watches too much TV
- [ ] Pop culture references reveal isolation (not just quirky)
- [ ] Casual, contemporary language throughout
- [ ] Self-corrections and rambling when stressed
- [ ] Specific details, not generic descriptions
- [ ] Humor is coping mechanism, doesn't dismiss stakes
- [ ] No flowery prose or purple language
- [ ] Dialogue feels natural when read aloud
- [ ] Powers described viscerally, not technically
- [ ] Cosmic elements grounded in casual observation

### Chess Structure Alignment

- [ ] Does this move the "game" forward?
- [ ] Is emotional state aligned with chess position?
- [ ] Does pacing match opening/middlegame/endgame phase?
- [ ] Are critical move moments given proper weight?
- [ ] Does structure support rather than constrain?

### Educational Quality (If Teaching Science)

- [ ] Anchor present? (Familiar analogy from Ahdia's experience)
- [ ] Struggle shown? (Her confusion and questions visible)
- [ ] Resolution earned? (Understanding feels like discovery, not lecture)
- [ ] Emotionally safe? (Would confused reader feel included or judged?)
- [ ] Extraneous load minimal? (No unnecessary jargon)
- [ ] Multi-level? (Experts notice accuracy without it being required)

### Continuity Checks (CRITICAL)

- [ ] Ahdia's baseline number matches tracker?
- [ ] Character knowledge consistent? (They don't know what they shouldn't yet)
- [ ] Seeds planted at correct depth? (Not too obvious, not too subtle)
- [ ] "Treatment ran long" excuse wearing thin at right pace?
- [ ] Relationships consistent? (Victor/Leah = lovers, Bourn = woman, etc.)
- [ ] Timeline consistent with month markers?
- [ ] Tragedy countdown intact? (Leta death foreshadowing, Ben's faith, etc.)

### The Undercurrent Check

For every chapter, ask: **How does "Why didn't you save her?" manifest here?**

- Ahdia: Guilt about Geneva, guilt about team, guilt about global ops
- Ruth: Firas, Ahdia (enabling), eventually everyone she can't triage
- Ben: Sarah, eventually the election
- Tess: Leta (warning wasn't enough)
- Leah: Leta (silence enabled harassment)

## The Golden Rules

1. **Would Ahdia actually think/say this?** If no → rewrite in her voice
2. **Does this pop culture reference reveal her isolation?** If no → cut or add context showing sadness
3. **Is this too polished?** Ahdia rambles, self-corrects, gets tangled in thoughts
4. **Am I trusting the reader?** Don't explain everything
5. **Is this specific enough?** "Thursday nights on SyFy" not "TV shows"

**Remember:** The chess is scaffolding, not the building. Structure enables freedom. You're not writing about chess - you're writing about a person learning they're enough.
