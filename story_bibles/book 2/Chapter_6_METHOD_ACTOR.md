**Setting:** Tess and Leta's apartment. Downtown Caledonia. 7 PM.

**Present:** Tess, Leta, later Korede

---

[NARRATOR]: Tess unlocked the apartment door at 7 PM, still in her work clothes—cocktail formal, nothing sexualized, the day shift dress code that marked her as professional rather than available. The heels came off immediately, kicked toward the closet with the kind of relief that suggested eight hours on her feet.

[AS TESS, calling out]:
"I'm home. Please tell me you ate actual food today."

[NARRATOR]: The apartment was small but lived-in. Organizing posters on the walls—trans rights, sex worker advocacy, community defense. The kitchen table was buried under paperwork, flyers, petitions waiting for signatures.

[AS LETA, from the couch, laptop open]:
"Define 'actual food.'"

[AS TESS, walking to the kitchen]:
"Something that wasn't a granola bar while typing angry emails."

[AS LETA]:
"Then no. But I made coffee, which is a vegetable."

[AS TESS, deadpan]:
"Coffee beans are seeds. You're thinking of tomatoes."

[NARRATOR]: Tess checked the fridge. Leftovers from three days ago. Condiments. Energy drinks. The food situation was exactly what she'd expected.

[AS TESS]:
"Okay, so we're ordering in. What are you feeling?"

[AS LETA, not looking up from laptop]:
"Whatever. I'm not hungry."

[AS TESS, knowing better]:
"You're ALWAYS hungry. You're just hyperfocused."

[AS LETA, finally looking up]:
"Fine. Thai. The place with the good papaya salad."

[NARRATOR]: Tess pulled out her phone, ordered their usual—she had it memorized. Then she walked to the couch, sat near Leta's feet, waited for her to close the laptop halfway.

[AS TESS]:
"ETA thirty minutes. Which gives you time to tell me about whatever made you forget to eat."

[AS LETA, slight smile]:
"That obvious?"

[AS TESS]:
"Babe, you do this every time you're onto something."

[AS LETA]:
"Okay, so, you know the coalition meeting last week?"

[NARRATOR]: She explained it while Tess settled in, feet finding their way into Leta's lap. Sex worker rights coalition connecting with trans advocacy networks. The overlap was obvious—many trans women did sex work out of survival, discrimination, limited options. They were building mutual aid infrastructure. Support systems that didn't involve cops.

[AS LETA]:
"De-escalation training, safe house network, legal support that doesn't out people."

[AS TESS]:
"You're doing the thing where you take on too much again."

[AS LETA, defensive]:
"It's important—"

[AS TESS]:
"I know it's important. I'm saying you don't have to do it alone."

[AS LETA, softer]:
"I'm not alone. Korede's been helping with outreach."

[AS TESS, concerned]:
"Your baby brother? He's what, seventeen?"

[AS LETA]:
"Eighteen in two months. And he WANTS to help."

[AS TESS]:
"Just... be careful what you're exposing him to, yeah?"

[NARRATOR]: Leta read her tone. Set the laptop aside fully.

[AS LETA]:
"You're worried."

[AS TESS]:
"I'm always worried. It's kind of my thing."

[AS LETA]:
"This is safer than a lot of what I've done. We're just organizing."

[AS TESS, investigator brain]:
"Organizing scares power. You know that."

[AS LETA]:
"So what, I should stop? Stay quiet?"

[AS TESS, quickly]:
"No. God, no. You're... you're amazing at this."

[AS TESS, struggling]:
"I just don't want you to get hurt."

[AS LETA, touching Tess's face]:
"Hey. I know what I'm doing."

[AS TESS, leaning into touch]:
"I know you do. Doesn't stop me from worrying."

[AS LETA]:
"Good thing I'm not asking you to stop."

[NARRATOR]: Quiet understanding passed between them. The kind that came from years of this—navigating systems designed to exclude them, fighting battles that shouldn't have to be fought.

[AS LETA]:
"How was work?"

[AS TESS, groaning]:
"Day shift is supposed to be chill. Supposed to be."

[AS LETA]:
"What happened?"

[AS TESS]:
"Bachelor party. At 2 PM. On a Wednesday."

[AS LETA, laughing]:
"Oh no."

[AS TESS]:
"Finance bros. Cocaine confident. Kept trying to negotiate 'extras.'"

[AS TESS, noir-comedy energy]:
"I told one guy, 'This is a gentleman's club, not a brothel. And even if it was, you couldn't afford me.'"

[AS LETA]:
"Did he back off?"

[AS TESS]:
"Not until security explained the house rules. With his face."

[AS LETA, concerned despite laugh]:
"You okay though?"

[AS TESS]:
"I'm fine. This is why I do days. Day shift: Businessmen on lunch breaks, retirees with disposable income, gentlemen who tip well and leave. Night shift: Bachelor parties, drunk twenty-somethings, finance bros who think they own you."

[AS LETA]:
"Strategic choice."

[AS TESS]:
"Professional boundaries. Plus day shift regulars? They talk. I learn things."

[AS LETA]:
"Things?"

[AS TESS, shrugging]:
"City dynamics. Power structures. Who's sleeping with who, who's screwing over who. You'd be surprised what men admit when they think you're not really listening."

[AS LETA, impressed]:
"You're gathering intel."

[AS TESS]:
"I'm paying attention. It's different."

[AS LETA]:
"Speaking of paying attention—anything interesting with Go Squad?"

[AS TESS, considering]:
"Patrol went sideways yesterday. Mob attack."

[AS LETA, immediately concerned]:
"Are you hurt?"

[AS TESS]:
"Bruised. Nothing serious. We got out."

[AS LETA]:
"Mob attack? What happened?"

[AS TESS]:
"People got scared of us. Like, overnight. Same neighborhoods that waved last week. Something's manipulating fear. Making people terrified."

[AS LETA, activist brain]:
"That's... that's a pretty effective control mechanism."

[AS TESS]:
"Make people afraid of the ones trying to help, they won't accept help. And when things get worse, they're isolated and desperate."

[AS LETA]:
"Someone's playing a long game."

[AS TESS]:
"Yeah. Don't know who yet. But I'll figure it out."

[NARRATOR]: Key in the door. Korede entering with his backpack.

[AS KOREDE, seventeen, Leta's brother]:
"I heard punching. Are we talking about the guy at the rally?"

[AS TESS]:
"Your sister's bringing up old news."

[AS KOREDE, grinning]:
"It was last WEEK."

[NARRATOR]: The doorbell rang—food delivery arrived faster than expected. Korede's face lit up.

[AS KOREDE]:
"Thai? Yes. I'm starving."

[AS LETA]:
"You're always starving. You're seventeen."

[AS KOREDE]:
"Almost eighteen. And that's how aging works, yeah."

[NARRATOR]: They settled into comfortable chaos—three people on a couch meant for two, containers distributed, TV on mute in the background. The kind of evening that felt like victory amidst everything else.

[AS KOREDE, mouth full]:
"So Tess, Go Squad stuff still weird?"

[AS TESS]:
"Define weird."

[AS KOREDE]:
"Mob attacked you guys? Like, actual civilians?"

[AS TESS]:
"Yeah. Got scared, got angry, got violent."

[AS KOREDE]:
"That's messed up."

[AS TESS]:
"Someone's making people afraid. Weaponizing fear."

[NARRATOR]: Leta's phone buzzed on the table. She glanced at it, frowned slightly.

[AS TESS, noticing]:
"What?"

[AS LETA]:
"Nothing. Just... social media stuff."

[AS KOREDE, looking over]:
"More nasty comments?"

[AS TESS, investigator instinct engaged]:
"More?"

[AS LETA, dismissive]:
"It's fine. Just trolls."

[AS KOREDE]:
"Three new burner accounts today. I've been helping block them."

[AS TESS, sitting up]:
"Three TODAY?"

[AS LETA, glaring at Korede]:
"You weren't supposed to worry her."

[AS KOREDE, defensive]:
"She should KNOW. It's getting coordinated."

[AS TESS]:
"Show me. Now."

[NARRATOR]: Leta sighed but handed over her phone. Tess scrolled through the messages—vicious, targeted, focusing specifically on Leta's trans and sex worker advocacy intersection.

[AS TESS]:
"This isn't random trolling. Someone's targeting your organizing."

[AS LETA]:
"Activists get targeted. It's part of the work."

[AS TESS]:
"That doesn't make it okay."

[AS LETA]:
"I know. But I'm not stopping because some assholes discovered Twitter."

[AS TESS, torn]:
"I'm not asking you to stop. I just... I need to know this is on my radar."

[AS LETA]:
"Your radar?"

[AS TESS]:
"Something feels off. The timing. Right when Go Squad's getting hit with fear manipulation? Makes me wonder if targeting activists is part of a larger pattern."

[AS LETA]:
"You think they're related?"

[AS TESS]:
"I think someone's making people afraid. Of us. Of you. Of anyone who organizes. Fear is a weapon. And someone just armed up."

[NARRATOR]: Leta processed this. Korede watched them both, seventeen years old and learning that his sister's work had consequences he hadn't fully understood.

[AS LETA]:
"Okay. So what do we do?"

[AS TESS]:
"Document everything. Screenshots, timestamps, account names. Build a case. Pattern recognition. See if it escalates."

[AS LETA]:
"And if it does?"

[AS TESS]:
"Then we deal with it. Together."

[AS LETA, small smile]:
"My knight in tactical muscle."

[AS TESS, deadpan]:
"I will never live that down, will I?"

[AS LETA]:
"Never."

[NARRATOR]: They settled back into the couch, food mostly eaten. Tess's arm around Leta, Leta's head on her shoulder. Comfortable, but both aware: Something was starting.

[AS LETA, after silence]:
"Thank you for worrying about me."

[AS TESS]:
"Can't help it. You're important."

[AS LETA]:
"To the organizing?"

[AS TESS]:
"To me."

[NARRATOR]: Outside the apartment window, visible from the street, a figure watched. Phone in hand. Taking photos.

The harassment was just beginning.

## SCENE 2: Ben - Alone with Grief

**Touchpoint A:** Ben comes home to empty apartment
**Touchpoint B:** Grief breaks through avoidance, work fails as coping

**Setting:** Ben's apartment. Late night. Military-precise, too clean.

**Present:** Ben, alone

---

[NARRATOR]: Ben's apartment was everything a military man's home should be. Clean lines, everything in its place, the kind of precision that came from decades of discipline.

Too clean. Too precise. No mess meant no living.

The kitchen had a single plate, a single mug. There used to be two of everything. The living room couch had dust on the cushions—he never sat there anymore. Photos had been removed from the walls, but you could see the outlines in the dust. Rectangles of absence.

He stood in the doorway after the CADENS debrief, still in tactical gear, and didn't want to enter.

[AS BEN, to the empty apartment]:
"Okay. I'm home."

[NARRATOR]: No one answered. No one had answered in eight months.

He finally moved, dropped his gear by the door—not his usual precision—and went straight to the bedroom. Not to sleep. To work.

His desk was buried in files. Kain investigation. Tank Kain massacre evidence. Timeline charts. Connection maps. This was what he did instead of feeling anything.

He opened his laptop. Pulled up surveillance footage. Cross-referenced Kain campaign events with riot locations. Built the pattern, connected the dots, lost himself in the work.

The clock showed 11 PM. He'd been at this for three hours.

The coffee mug beside his laptop was cold. He'd made it this morning.

[NARRATOR]: Work was safer than remembering. He'd learned that eight months ago, when work became the only thing between him and the kind of grief that swallowed people whole.

It had worked for seven months. It was starting to fail now.

He sorted through riot footage, looking for patterns, and a face caught his eye. Woman, mid-thirties, caught in mob panic. Nothing significant to the investigation. Just background.

But something about her expression—fear, confusion, trying to help someone else escape.

[NARRATOR]: Sarah. Her name was Sarah.

His wife had had that same look. Eight months ago. The peaceful protest that turned violent. Agent provocateurs and something else—Eidolon, they were calling it now, though they hadn't known that then. She'd been there because she was always at protests. Activist. Community organizer. Couldn't stay quiet when people needed help.

She tried to de-escalate. Got caught in the stampede.

Died helping someone else escape.

And Ben had been across town on a Go Squad operation, saving strangers, while his wife died alone.

[NARRATOR]: The woman on the screen wasn't Sarah. But she could have been. Should have been. Wasn't.

The laptop screen blurred. Tears he hadn't felt coming.

[AS BEN, voice breaking]:
"Fuck."

[NARRATOR]: He tried to keep working. Couldn't focus. Eight months of avoidance cracking all at once.

He got up. Paced. Military precision falling apart with every step.

In the kitchen, he opened a cabinet. Sarah's favorite tea was still there. He'd kept it because he couldn't use it and couldn't throw it away. Her mug, collecting dust beside it.

He touched the mug and broke down properly. Not crying—gasping. Drowning. Eight months of suppressed grief hitting all at once. He slid down the cabinet, sitting on the kitchen floor in tactical gear, and let it happen.

The work wasn't working anymore. The avoidance had failed.

[NARRATOR]: Internal voice, the one he'd been silencing:

He wasn't investigating Kain to get justice. He was investigating to avoid feeling this.

If he worked hard enough, built the case well enough, caught Kain... maybe Sarah's death would have meaning. Maybe it wouldn't have been random, senseless, preventable.

But it was random. Agent provocateur could have hit any protest. She was just there. Wrong place, wrong time.

No cosmic significance. No grand narrative. Just gone.

[NARRATOR]: Ben's conservative ideology had always said the system worked if you worked hard enough. Follow the rules. Do the right thing. Trust the institutions.

The system had killed his wife. The institutions had failed. And he couldn't process that yet—that reckoning was still coming, months away—so he kept investigating, kept working, kept pretending it fixed something.

It didn't. It never had.

But it was all he knew how to do.

[NARRATOR]: Still on the kitchen floor, grief subsiding to numbness, he pulled out his wallet. Military habit. Hidden compartment.

Photo of Sarah. Not the wedding photo—too formal. A candid shot. Her laughing.

That's what he missed most. Her laugh.

She'd been funny. Sharp. Politically active. They disagreed on almost everything—he was conservative, she was activist—but they talked. Really talked. Challenged each other.

She'd been changing him slowly, without either of them realizing it.

And then she was gone.

And he was stuck. Half-changed, half-conservative, fully broken.

Couldn't go back to who he was. She'd changed him too much.

Couldn't move forward. She wasn't there to show him how.

[NARRATOR]: His phone buzzed. Ruth checking in—she did that, noticed who was struggling.

Text: "You good? Haven't heard from you since debrief."

Ben typed "I'm fine." Deleted it.

Typed "Just working." Deleted it.

Typed "Yeah, all good." Deleted it.

[AS BEN, finally sending]:
"Processing. Talk tomorrow?"

[AS RUTH, responding]:
"Yeah. I'm here if you need."

[NARRATOR]: He sat on the kitchen floor with Sarah's photo. Two options: Keep working until he passed out—the usual method. Or actually process the grief.

He wasn't ready for option two.

He got up slowly. Put the photo back in his wallet. Returned to the desk. Opened the laptop.

Back to the Kain investigation. The familiar pain.

But something was different now. He knew it was avoidance. Knew it wouldn't work. Did it anyway because he didn't know what else to do.

Work as coping mechanism: failing.

But it was the only coping mechanism he had.

So he kept building the case, connecting dots, pretending it mattered while the screen reflected his face—exhausted, broken, pretending to function.

## DIRECTOR NOTES - Scene 2

**Requirements met:**
- [x] Ben's grief established (wife Sarah, eight months ago, protest violence)
- [x] Work as avoidance (building case to avoid feeling)
- [x] Coping mechanism failing (can't keep grief suppressed)
- [x] Conservative ideology cracking (system failed, wife died)
- [x] Isolation visible (no support network, pushed people away)
- [x] Ruth checking in (someone notices, he's not ready to accept help)

**State changes:**
- Ben status: Avoidance cracking, grief surfacing
- Investigation motivation: Revealed as displacement
- Support: Ruth reaching out, Ben deflecting

**Consequences propagating:**
- When evidence fails Month 8, Ben's conservative faith breaks
- Book 4: Full breakdown when system completely fails
- Need for support network established (doesn't have one yet)

---

## Chapter 6 Summary

**What happened:**
1. Tess came home to Leta, domestic intimacy established
2. Early harassment against Leta noticed (three burner accounts)
3. Tess's protective instincts engaged, connection to Eidolon suspected
4. External watcher documented harassment beginning
5. Ben alone in apartment, grief breaking through avoidance
6. Work as coping mechanism shown failing
7. Ruth checking in, Ben deflecting support

**Parallel structure:**
- Tess/Leta/Korede: Connection as healing (together, supported)
- Ben: Isolation as avoidance (alone, suppressing)
- Same city, same night, different ways of processing trauma

**Seeds planted:**
- Harassment will escalate Month 5-7
- Ben's breaking point when evidence fails
- Korede's radicalization arc
- Ruth as support figure (notices, reaches out)

**Thematic function:**
- "You don't have to be fixed to be worthy" - Both paths shown
- But connection heals, isolation doesn't
- Work can't replace grief
- Community matters
